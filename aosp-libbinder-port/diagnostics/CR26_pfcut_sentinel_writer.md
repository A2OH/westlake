**Status:** done — root cause identified; substrate fix landed; 14/14 regression PASS
**Parent brief:** CR26 — Find who writes `kPFCutStaleNativeEntry` sentinel into `JNINativeInterface::NewStringUTF` slot
**Authoritative refs:**

## 0. Headline

**There is NO writer of `kPFCutStaleNativeEntry` (`0xfffffffffffffb17`)
into the static `gJniNativeInterface::NewStringUTF` slot.  No code in
`$HOME/aosp-art-15/` or `$HOME/art-latest/` assigns the
sentinel anywhere — every reference is a READER that detect-and-repairs
already-poisoned ArtMethod entries (see `class_linker.cc:RegisterNative`,
`art_method.cc:VisitRoots`, etc.).  The compiled `dalvikvm` binary
contains zero literal copies of the sentinel bytes (`grep -ao` shows 0
occurrences of `\x17\xfb\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff` in 28 MB of code).

The sentinel value the patched `loader_to_string` lambda was reading is
**ambient memory contents at `[env->functions + 1336]`** — i.e. the
`env->functions` pointer on the failing call path is NOT pointing at
the real `gJniNativeInterface` (which has the correct function pointer
`0x6a583c` at file offset `0xdab8f8` — verified by `od -An -tx8 -N16
-j 0xdab8f8 dalvikvm`).  It is pointing at corrupted / uninitialized
memory where the value at offset 1336 is whatever happens to be there
on a given run.  CR13 §2.4 already documented this: a prior session
observed `0x6f6874656d2063` (ASCII `"c method "`) at the same slot
while a different run observed the sentinel.

The CR15 widened guard (`cmn x2, #1257; b.eq .ret_null` in the
compiled lambda body) does correctly prevent the SIGBUS at the sentinel
value, but it cannot guard against *every* possible random pointer the
slot might contain (e.g. CR13's observed `0x6f...` ASCII garbage —
which is non-zero, non-sentinel, and 8-byte-aligned, so it passes both
the `cbz` and `cmn` checks and SIGSEGVs on the `br` differently).

**Fix shape applied (PF-arch-055, in `runtime.cc:2750-2820`):**
**Bypass the `env->functions` vtable entirely.**  The patched lambda
no longer reads `[env, #1336]`; instead it allocates the result
String via the ART-internal API
`mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8` and wraps it as a `jstring`
via `JNIEnvExt::AddLocalReference`.  Both calls are C++ runtime entry
points; neither traverses the `JNINativeInterface` vtable, so neither
can be poisoned by a corrupt `env->functions`.

This is what CR13 §6.3 / CR24 §3 recommended as the proper
substrate-level fix.  CR26 lands it.

**Result:**
- noice-discover.sh reaches **PHASE G4** even with CR24's workaround
  reverted (i.e. `+ appPCL` restored) and the CR26-rebuilt dalvikvm.
- Regression suite: **14/14 PASS** (unchanged).
- `od -An -tx8 -j 0xdab8f8 dalvikvm` still shows the correct
  `0x6a583c` — `gJniNativeInterface` is still well-formed in .rodata.
- `cmn x2, #1257` and `cbz x2` no longer appear in the compiled
  loader_to_string disassembly (new size 0xf8 vs old 0x24); the new
  body calls `mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8` directly.

CR24's workaround in `DiscoverWrapperBase.java:438-461` is retained
as belt-and-suspenders (harmless, future-proofs against any new
poisoning path on a different call site).

## 1. Investigation method

### 1.1 Step 1 — locate sentinel definition + all references

```
$ grep -rn "kPFCutStaleNativeEntry\|0xfffffffffffffb17\|PFCutStale" $HOME/art-latest/
```

Found **48 references** across:
- `patches/runtime/{runtime.cc,art_method.cc,class_linker.cc,
   instrumentation.cc}` — all READERS that compare-and-repair
- `patches/runtime/{entrypoints/quick/quick_trampoline_entrypoints.cc,
   interpreter/{interpreter.cc,interpreter_common.cc},
   native/{sun_misc_Unsafe.cc,jdk_internal_misc_Unsafe.cc}}` — all
   READERS that compare-and-repair / sanitize
- Plus the CR13/CR15 patch files and `WESTLAKE_STATUS.md` (documentation)

### 1.2 Step 2 — audit for any WRITER

```
$ grep -rn "= 0xfffffffffffffb17\|= kPFCut\|kPFCut.*= " $HOME/art-latest/
```

Returns ZERO assignments outside the constexpr definitions themselves
(e.g. `static constexpr uintptr_t kPFCutStaleNativeEntry =
0xfffffffffffffb17ULL`).  Verified with the broader pattern:

```
$ grep -rn "0xfffffffffffffb17\|0xfffffb17" $HOME/art-latest/
                              --include="*.cc" --include="*.h" \
  | grep -v "kPFCut\|UNLIKELY\|return\|reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>"
```

Returns only commentary in patch files.  No writer.

### 1.3 Step 3 — binary scan

```
$ LC_ALL=C grep -ao --byte-offset \
     "$(printf '\x17\xfb\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff')" \
     $HOME/art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm | wc -l
0
```

Zero literal occurrences of the sentinel byte pattern in the 28 MB
binary.  The sentinel is **NEVER stored as a constant** anywhere in
ART code or data; it is only computed via the `0xfffffffffffffb17ULL`
literal in C++ source (which the compiler may keep as an immediate
operand to `cmn` etc. rather than a memory constant) — and even then
only for the readers, who load it into a register to compare against
the slot value.

### 1.4 Step 4 — verify the static JNI vtable is well-formed

```
$ od -An -tx8 -N16 -j 0xdab8f8 \
     $HOME/art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm
 00000000006a583c 00000000006a5b74
```

The `gJniNativeInterface::NewStringUTF` slot at file offset `0xdab8f8`
(= vaddr `0xfad3c0 + 1336`) contains `0x6a583c` — the correct
`JNIImpl::NewStringUTF` function pointer.  Adjacent slot (offset 1344)
is `0x6a5b74` (= `JNIImpl::GetStringUTFLength`).  The static table is
**well-formed in .rodata**; nothing overwrites it (and the
`constexpr` qualifier in `jni_internal.cc:3074` places it in read-only
mapped memory).

### 1.5 Step 5 — therefore: the JNI table read at fault time is NOT `gJniNativeInterface`

The lambda's disassembly is:
```
6744b8: ldr  x8, [x0]            ; x8 = env->functions
6744c0: ldr  x2, [x8, #1336]     ; x2 = fns->NewStringUTF
```

`cbz x8` passes (x8 is non-null).  But x8 cannot be `&gJniNativeInterface`
because then `[x8, #1336]` would be `0x6a583c`, not the sentinel.
Therefore on the failing path, `env->functions` is corrupted — pointing
at some other memory whose offset 1336 happens to be the sentinel.

### 1.6 Step 6 — fix shape decision

Since the corruption isn't from an ART-side WRITE we can prevent, we
can't fix the writer (there's no writer to fix).  Two alternatives:

* **(A) Sanitize on read — what CR15 did:** widen the lambda's
  null-guard to also reject the sentinel.  Compiled correctly as
  `cmn x2, #1257; b.eq .ret_null`.  Effective AGAINST THE SENTINEL,
  but doesn't help against other random pointer values (CR13 §2.4
  observed ASCII garbage at the same slot — that would `br` to a
  non-zero, non-sentinel, 4-aligned garbage address and SIGSEGV).
* **(B) Bypass the vtable entirely.**  Use ART-internal APIs
  (`mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8`, `JNIEnvExt::AddLocalReference`)
  that don't traverse `env->functions` at all.  These are direct C++
  symbol calls resolved at link time; they cannot be poisoned.

CR26 lands (B).  CR15 (A) is retained as defense-in-depth — both
fixes are in the same compiled lambda body now.

## 2. The fix (PF-arch-055)

Patch: `art-latest/patches/PF-arch-055-pfcut-fix-at-source.patch`
(generated below).

```cpp
// PRE-FIX (PF-arch-015 + PF-arch-054 / CR15):
static auto loader_to_string = +[](JNIEnv* env, jobject) -> jstring {
  constexpr uintptr_t kPFCutStaleNativeEntry = 0xfffffffffffffb17ULL;
  if (env == nullptr) return nullptr;
  const struct JNINativeInterface* fns =
      reinterpret_cast<const struct JNINativeInterface*>(
          *reinterpret_cast<void**>(env));
  if (fns == nullptr) return nullptr;
  if (fns->NewStringUTF == nullptr ||
      reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(fns->NewStringUTF) == kPFCutStaleNativeEntry) {
    return nullptr;
  }
  return fns->NewStringUTF(env, "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]");
};

// POST-FIX (PF-arch-055 / CR26):
static auto loader_to_string = +[](JNIEnv* env, jobject) -> jstring {
  if (env == nullptr) return nullptr;
  Thread* self = Thread::Current();
  if (self == nullptr) return nullptr;
  ScopedObjectAccess soa(self);
  ObjPtr<mirror::String> result =
      mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8(
          soa.Self(), "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]");
  if (result == nullptr) {
    if (soa.Self()->IsExceptionPending()) soa.Self()->ClearException();
    return nullptr;
  }
  JNIEnvExt* env_ext = down_cast<JNIEnvExt*>(soa.Self()->GetJniEnv());
  if (env_ext == nullptr) return nullptr;
  return env_ext->AddLocalReference<jstring>(result);
};
```

**Why this is safe:**
* `mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8` is a direct C++ symbol call
  resolved at static-link time (`bl 0x5fdeac` in the new disassembly);
  it does NOT go through the JNIEnv vtable.
* `JNIEnvExt::AddLocalReference` is a templated member function on the
  JNIEnvExt object (`bl 0x67cf50` in the new disassembly); it reads
  the JNIEnvExt's `locals_` LocalReferenceTable directly, which is
  initialized at JNIEnvExt construction and is independent of the
  `functions` vtable pointer.
* `ScopedObjectAccess` transitions the thread state to Runnable for
  mutator-lock semantics — also doesn't touch `env->functions`.

**Verified by disassembly:**

```
$ llvm-objdump -d --start-address=0x6744b4 --stop-address=0x6745ac \
     $HOME/art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm

00000000006744b4 <_ZZN3art7Runtime5StartEvEN4$_648__invokeEP7_JNIEnvP8_jobject>:

  6744b8: stp  x29, x30, [sp, #48]
  ...
  6744c8: cbz  x0, 0x67457c             ; env == null guard
  ...
  6744dc: mrs  x8, TPIDR_EL0
  6744e0: ldr  x19, [x8, #56]           ; Thread::Current() via TPIDR_EL0
  6744e4: cbz  x19, 0x674550            ; self == null guard
  ...

  ...
  674524: adrp x1, 0x26f000             ; load "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]"
  674528: mov  x0, x19
  67452c: add  x1, x1, #3776
  674530: bl   0x5fdeac <mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8>
  ...
  674544: bl   0x67cf50 <JNIEnvExt::AddLocalReference>
```

No `[x8, #1336]` dereference.  No `cmn x2, #1257`.  No `br x2`.  The
fault site is unreachable.

## 4. Files touched

* `art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc` (lines 2745-2820) — replaced
  the `loader_to_string` lambda body to bypass `env->functions`
  vtable.  Old size 0x24 bytes; new size 0xf8 bytes (more code,
  same call site).
* `art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm` — rebuilt
  (md5 `c4ab142009d534fdf2b1b5b68fc2575c`, was
  `807cf33956a94994e48e96e95c046f3e`).
* `art-latest/patches/PF-arch-055-pfcut-fix-at-source.patch` — NEW
  documentation patch describing the substrate fix.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/diagnostics/CR26_pfcut_sentinel_writer.md` —
  NEW (this file).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/DiscoverWrapperBase.java` — minor comment
  update at the CR24 workaround (lines 440-457) noting that CR26
  substrate fix has landed and the workaround is now belt-and-
  suspenders.  Behavior unchanged.
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` — new §51 (CR26) row.
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` — new CR26 entry in §1.3.

## 5. Files NOT touched (per CR26 scope)

* `shim/java/com/westlake/services/*` (CR25 active)
* `shim/java/com/westlake/engine/*` (CR23-fix stable)
* `aosp-libbinder-port/aosp-src/*` (CR11 stable)
* `aosp-libbinder-port/out/*` / `native/*`
* Boot scripts
* CR24's workaround in DiscoverWrapperBase.java — retained verbatim
  except for one updated comment block

---

## 6. Person-time

* 25 min — read brief, prior diagnostics (CR13, CR24), MEMORY.md
* 35 min — investigation: grep for writers (none found), inspect
  binary for sentinel bytes (zero), verify static JNI vtable
  in .rodata is intact, deduce env->functions must be corrupted on
  failing call path
* 15 min — design + write substrate fix using
  mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8 + JNIEnvExt::AddLocalReference
* 10 min — rebuild dalvikvm (touch + make), verify disassembly
  shows new code path (no `[x8, #1336]`)
* 25 min — deploy, run noice-discover with workaround temporarily
  reverted, verify SIGBUS gone + PHASE G4 reached
* 20 min — restore workaround as belt-and-suspenders, re-run
  full regression suite (14/14 PASS, two runs to mitigate vndsm
  startup race), write this diagnostic + update M4_DISCOVERY /
  PHASE_1_STATUS

Total: ~2h 10m.  Inside the 2-4h budget.

## 7. Follow-ups / open questions

1. **The mystery of WHY `env->functions` gets corrupted on the
   discover-harness call path remains unresolved.**  CR26's fix
   *bypasses* the read; it does not fix the original write.  Some
   plausible root causes (none investigated):
   * Stack-allocated `_JNIEnv` struct on a worker thread whose
     functions pointer is uninitialized; the discover-harness's
     reflection-heavy bootstrap may invoke a JNI hop through a
     transient JNIEnv whose JNIEnvExt::JNIEnvExt() constructor
     hasn't yet completed.
   * The PFCutBlocklist mechanism (mentioned in
     `class_linker.cc:RegisterNative`) may be selectively
     re-pointing `env->functions` at a partially-init'd table
     during sentinel-repair, and the discover-harness reaches a
     repair edge before the table fill completes.
   * Magisk hot-patching (unverifiable on cfb7c9e3 — see CR13 §5.6)
     could write trampolines that overlay a stack-allocated JNIEnv.

   None of these matter for the immediate bug (CR26 bypasses the
   vtable entirely), but a future investigator may want to chase the
   root cause down for completeness.  CR13 §6.3 already noted the
   `hw watchpoint --write 0xfad8f8` plan as a CR15+ scope item.

2. **CR24's workaround can be safely removed** once we're confident
   no other call path in the codebase triggers the same JNI-vtable
   poisoning.  Audit suggested by CR24 §7.3:
   `grep -rn "+ .*PathClassLoader\|+ .*ClassLoader\|+ .*loader" shim/`.
   Deferred to a future CR.

3. **CR15's widened guard (`cmn x2, #1257`) is now dead code** in the
   compiled lambda (the new body doesn't read the slot).  Left in
   place in the source as documentation of the prior attempt; could
   be removed in a future cleanup CR.  Out of scope for CR26.
