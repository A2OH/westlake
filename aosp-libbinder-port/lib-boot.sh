# lib-boot.sh — shared boot helpers for Westlake binder-pivot test scripts.
#
# Sourced by m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh and sandbox-boot.sh.
#
# Provides:
#   wait_for_vndservicemanager_dead [timeout_s]
#       After `setprop ctl.stop vndservicemanager`, poll `pidof vndservicemanager`
#       until empty (or timeout). Returns 0 if the daemon is gone, 1 otherwise.
#       Default timeout: 15 seconds.
#
#   stop_vndservicemanager_synchronously [timeout_s]
#       1. setprop ctl.stop vndservicemanager
#       2. wait_for_vndservicemanager_dead $timeout_s
#       3. If still alive, escalate with `kill -9 $(pidof vndservicemanager)`
#          and re-poll for 2s.
#       Returns 0 if the daemon is gone, 1 otherwise.
#
# Background — CR7 (2026-05-12, [REDACTED-EMAIL]):
#   `setprop ctl.stop X` returns immediately; init handles the stop async.
#   m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh and sandbox-boot.sh historically waited a flat `sleep 1`
#   and then bailed out if `pidof vndservicemanager` was still alive ("ERROR:
#   vndservicemanager refused to stop"). On a busy phone — especially during
#   D2's binder-pivot-regression.sh which rapidly cycles 13 tests — 1s is not
#   enough for init to actually reap vndservicemanager. The previous test's
#   `setprop ctl.start vndservicemanager` and the next test's
#   `setprop ctl.stop vndservicemanager` can also collide with init's
#   rate-limiter (which throttles too-rapid svc cycles). The net effect is
#   that ~7/8 M4 tests fail with `BINDER_SET_CONTEXT_MGR` returning EBUSY
#   because the device's vndservicemanager is still holding /dev/vndbinder's
#   context-manager slot when our SM tries to claim it.
#
#   The fix here: poll for daemon death, not blind sleep.
#
# Anti-patterns rejected:
#   - Unbounded waits (cap at the configured timeout with a clear failure)
#   - Per-app branches (these helpers are app-agnostic)
#   - Modifying noice-discover.sh's working logic (it runs ONCE per session
#     and doesn't trip the rate-limiter — we leave it alone)
