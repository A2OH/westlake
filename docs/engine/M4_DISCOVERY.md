# M4 Discovery Results — noice bootstrap under the W2 sandbox

**Date:** 2026-05-12 (initial); 2026-05-13 (V2-Step1..Step8-fix added §52 entries; M4-PRE12/13/14, CR15, CR17, CR18, CR23-fix marked SUPERSEDED-V2)
**Subject app:** `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice` v2.5.7 (24 MB APK on phone)
**Test harness:** `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` + `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover.sh`
**Run output:** `/data/local/tmp/westlake/noice-discover.log` on phone (also pulled to `/tmp/noice-discover2.log`)
**Author:** W2-discover agent (initial); twelve+ later agents extended sections §12-§30 in chronological completion order.

This document is the canonical inventory of which Binder services + transactions noice exercises during its `Application.onCreate()` / `MainActivity.onCreate()` bootstrap. It feeds the M4a-e implementation milestones with a concrete TODO list, not speculation.

## Section index (post-DOC1 renumber)

The first 11 sections (§1-§11) are the original W2-discover analysis; every
subsequent §N corresponds to one milestone landing or one re-discovery
iteration, in chronological completion order. The mapping below is the
canonical lookup table; PHASE_1_STATUS.md and BINDER_PIVOT_MILESTONES.md
both refer to these numbers.

| §   | Milestone               | One-line description                                                |

| §16 | M4-PRE4 post-discovery   | MessageQueue/Looper JNI bridge (6 natives); Activity.attach reachable |
| §17 | M4a landed               | WestlakeActivityManagerService (267 methods, 16 Tier-1 real impls) |
| §18 | M4-PRE5 post-discovery   | WestlakePackageManagerStub (179 methods); attachBaseContext advances 22→193 |
| §19 | CR2 fail-loud conversion | Silent no-ops → ServiceMethodMissing.fail() for activity + power   |
| §20 | M4-PRE6 post-discovery   | WestlakeResources factory via Unsafe(ResourcesImpl); 193→523 dex_pc |

| §24 | M4b landed               | WestlakeWindowManagerService (154 methods, 11 Tier-1 real impls)   |
| §25 | CR4 layout_inflater wiring | wrapProcessLocal + PhoneLayoutInflater; PhoneWindow reaches dex_pc=123 |
| §26 | M5-PRE landed            | AudioSystem native stubs (105) statically linked; clinit succeeds  |
| §27 | M4-PRE9 post-discovery   | WestlakeContentResolver (Proxy IContentProvider); Settings.Global fallback works |
| §28 | M4d + M4e batch landed   | WestlakeDisplayManagerService (64), WestlakeNotificationManagerService (167), WestlakeInputMethodManagerService (37); on-device test deferred |
| §29 | CR5 wrap registry extension | SystemServiceWrapperRegistry adds window/display/notification/input_method wrap arms; build verified, on-device test deferred |
| §30 | M4-PRE10 post-discovery  | Inline `primeCharsetState()` in NoiceDiscoverWrapper; Charset.UTF_8 / defaultCharset seeded; Settings.Global.getStringForUser NPE resolved; **PHASE G3 Activity.attach now PASSES**; new failure point is PHASE G4 (`MainActivity.onCreate` → Hilt `Contexts.getApplication` IllegalStateException) |
| §31 | CR7 EBUSY race fix       | Synchronous `wait_for_vndservicemanager_dead` polling in boot scripts; new `aosp-libbinder-port/lib-boot.sh` helper; HelloBinder's `BINDER_SET_CONTEXT_MGR EBUSY` race on regression suite resolved |
| §32 | M4-PRE11 post-discovery  | `WestlakeContextImpl.getApplicationContext` returns the attached noice Application via `setAttachedApplication(Application)` setter (Option A from §30.7); NoiceDiscoverWrapper calls the setter after `attachBaseContext` in both PHASE D and PHASE G; **expected to clear** Hilt `Contexts.getApplication` IllegalStateException at PHASE G4; build verified, on-device test deferred |
| §33 | CR9 shared CharsetPrimer | Extract M4-PRE10's `primeCharsetState` into new reusable `aosp-libbinder-port/test/CharsetPrimer.java` (157 LOC); bundle into 5 dexes (4 M4 service tests + discovery wrapper); call as line 1 of each test's `main()`; `NoiceDiscoverWrapper` refactored to delegate; **Charset NPE eliminated** from all 4 failing service tests but **secondary `ActivityThread.getSystemContext()` NPE** in `IDisplayManager/INotificationManager/IInputMethodManager` Stub.<init> now exposed (CR10 candidate); regression 8/13 PASS unchanged in count but `SystemServiceRouteTest` advances exit 21 → 101 (all wrap arms before display succeed); `noice-discover` regression confirms PHASE G3 still PASSES after refactor |
| §34 | M4-PRE12 post-discovery  | **[SUPERSEDED-V2 — Step 4 deleted this plant code; see §52 V2-Step4 / `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §3.4 + §7 Step 4]** `WestlakeResources.createSyntheticAssetManager` plants real `TypedValue` on `mValue` + `long[2]` on `mOffsets` to fix `AssetManager.getResourceText` outValue NPE; verified on device; new failure point at `Locale.toLanguageTag()` on null receiver inside `AppCompatDelegateImpl.applyDayNight` chain |
| §35 | M4-PRE13 post-discovery  | **[SUPERSEDED-V2 — Step 4 deleted this plant code; see §52 V2-Step4 / `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §3.4 + §7 Step 4]** `WestlakeResources.buildDefaultConfiguration` planted `Locale.US` + `new LocaleList(Locale.US)` on synthetic Configuration via `Configuration.setLocales(LocaleList)` + direct `mLocaleList` + legacy `locale` field; verified on device; new failure at `DisplayAdjustments.getCompatibilityInfo()` null receiver in `ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl` dex_pc=36 |
| §36 | M4-PRE14 post-discovery  | **[SUPERSEDED-V2 — Step 4 deleted this plant code; see §52 V2-Step4 / `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §3.4 + §7 Step 4]** `WestlakeResources.plantDisplayAdjustments` planted `new DisplayAdjustments()` on synthetic `ResourcesImpl.mDisplayAdjustments`; build verified, on-device test blocked by **pre-existing PHASE B SIGBUS** in `BaseDexClassLoader.toString()` (causation revert-test confirmed unrelated to M4-PRE14); DEVICE-RECOVERY-1 needed |
| §37 | CR10 post-discovery      | `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread()` plants synthetic `ActivityThread.sCurrentActivityThread` + `mSystemContext = BootstrapContext` (nested `ContextWrapper` whose `getSystemService("permission_enforcer")` returns a planted `PermissionEnforcer`); call site added to 5 test mains; root-cause-fixes `IDisplayManager/INotificationManager/IInputMethodManager.Stub.<init>` NPE chain; on-device test deferred (phone `cfb7c9e3` disconnected mid-regression) |
| §38 | M4c landed               | `WestlakePackageManagerService` (223-method `IPackageManager.Stub` subclass, 15 Tier-1 real impls, 208 fail-loud overrides); 8 new AIDL stubs; SystemServiceWrapperRegistry adds `"package"` wrap case; on-device test deferred (device offline) |
| §39 | CR12 diagnostic          | Binder topology investigation: confirmed `/dev/binder` + `/dev/hwbinder` + `/dev/vndbinder` ALL present on cfb7c9e3 (the "missing devices" was a shell-glob false alarm in the brief's probe); kernel 4.9.337 lacks `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDERFS`, so `/dev/binderfs/` is an inert mount-point breadcrumb from LineageOS init.rc; **zero boot-script change required**; CR7-hardened `sandbox-boot.sh` continues to work against `/dev/vndbinder` |
| §40 | CR11 fix landed          | `Parcel::enforceInterface` receive-side widened from strict equality `if (header != kHeader)` to set-membership `{SYST, VNDR, RECO, UNKN}`; patch 0004; on-device verified zero `Mixing copies of libbinder` errors; PHASE A completes (70 probes, 4 hits, 66 misses), PHASE B reached |
| §41 | CR14 launcher slim       | Executed C4 audit `[DELETE-after-M4]` dispositions: 17/21 sections processed; pure-delete S43/S42/S28/S21/S18/S6 + stub-body S38-40/S27/S26/S19/S20-partial/S34/S32/S36; `WestlakeLauncher.java` 22,983 → 13,528 LOC (-41%); `aosp-shim.dex` 1,577,644 → 1,393,148 bytes (-184 KB / -11.7%); HelloBinder PASS; S15/S16/S3/S12 deferred (mainImpl coupling or external API surface) |
| §42 | CR13 diagnostic          | Post-reboot PHASE B SIGBUS reproduces deterministically at `0xfffffffffffffb17` (PF-arch-053 sentinel family — `kPFCutStaleNativeEntry`) in `art_quick_generic_jni_trampoline` → patched `loader_to_string` lambda's `br x2` where `x2 = fns->NewStringUTF` is corrupted; the lambda's `if (fns->NewStringUTF == nullptr)` null-guard in `art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc:2750-2757` admits the sentinel because sentinel ≠ 0; the `BaseDexClassLoader.toString()` call-site claim in the PFCUT-SIGNAL output is a stack-walking artifact — actual crash is during `new PathClassLoader(noice.apk, ...)` ctor, before `noicePCL` is assigned; five reproducers (PclProbe / V2 / V3 / V5 / V6) with same BCP + same ServiceRegistrar + same 70-probe PASS, proving the fault is shape-specific to `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex`'s class-link footprint; H1 (clear `westlake/arm64/*` boot cache), H2 (SELinux Permissive), H3 (`randomize_va_space=0` ASLR off), H7 (ServiceRegistrar class init) all DISPROVED; recommended Tier-2 fix is a 2-line widen-the-guard patch to `runtime.cc` (CR14-class follow-up, NOT applied here per "FILES NOT TO TOUCH: `art-latest/*`"); HelloBinder/AsInterfaceTest/bcp-sigbus-repro.sh all still PASS — substrate is healthy |
| §46 | CR17 M4d/M4e PermissionEnforcer-bypass in production | **[SUPERSEDED-V2 — V2 substrate substitutes at the `Activity.attach` / `Application.attach` boundary so the cold-boot ActivityThread chain that CR17 worked around is no longer on the V2 critical path; M4d/M4e service Stub-ctor logic survives unchanged for the binder fallback path but the `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread` + `ColdBootstrap.ensure` defense-in-depth is now optional. See §52 / `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §5 (what survives) + §6 (what gets removed)]** Codex review #2 HIGH finding: `WestlakeDisplayManagerService` / `WestlakeNotificationManagerService` / `WestlakeInputMethodManagerService` used `super()` default ctors that NPE without `ActivityThread.sCurrentActivityThread` planted; production callers via `ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices()` (invoked by `WestlakeLauncher` during real-app boot) don't have the test-harness primer, so the services NPE'd at registration. Fixed by applying the same `Stub(PermissionEnforcer)` bypass pattern already used by M4a/M4b/M4c/M4-power — each service ctor now `super(new NoopPermissionEnforcer())` where `NoopPermissionEnforcer extends android.os.PermissionEnforcer` and its no-arg ctor returns with `mContext=null`. Matching `Stub(PermissionEnforcer)` ctor overload added to the 3 shim AIDL Stubs (`IDisplayManager`, `INotificationManager`, `IInputMethodManager`). `DisplayServiceTest` / `NotificationServiceTest` / `InputMethodServiceTest` had their `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread()` calls removed (proven self-sufficient — all 3 PASS without it). `SystemServiceRouteTest` + `NoiceDiscoverWrapper` retain the primer as defense-in-depth (removing it from `SystemServiceRouteTest` caused reproducible PF-arch-054 SIGBUS, so the primer is warming additional state on those paths). `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread` docstring updated to "partially superseded". Regression suite: 12 PASS / 1 FAIL (the 1 FAIL is CR15's known noice-discover PF-arch-054 SIGBUS — independent of CR17). |
| §48 | CR18 primer bisection + ColdBootstrap | **[SUPERSEDED-V2 — V2 substrate makes the primer optional (see V2-Step7 audit row of `V2_STEP7_PLANT_RESIDUE_AUDIT.md` Target 2); `ColdBootstrap.ensure` retained as belt-and-suspenders but ActivityThread cold-boot graph is no longer V2's critical path. See §52 V2-Step7 + `MIGRATION_FROM_V1.md` §5]** CR18 brief asked to bisect the CR15/CR17 claim that "stripping `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread()` from `SystemServiceRouteTest.main()` causes PF-arch-054 SIGBUS at PHASE B (3/3 reproducible)". Added a `primeActivityThreadVariant(int flags)` bitmask entry point to `CharsetPrimer` (3 knobs: INSTALL=0x1 / ENFORCER_CTX=0x2 / BARE_CTX=0x4) and a corresponding `primerVariant` constant in `SystemServiceRouteTest`. Ran 5 variants on `cfb7c9e3` with N=4-8 each: variant 0 (NO primer at all) **PASSED 8/8** with zero SIGBUS occurrences; variant 3 (full primer, pre-CR18 default) 5/5 PASS; variants 1/2/5 all PASS (modulo unrelated vndservicemanager rebind flakes and a phone-USB disconnect). Bisection conclusion: the primer is no longer load-bearing — the CR15/CR17 SIGBUS correlation was non-deterministic noise OR was resolved by CR17's Stub-bypass landings (which eliminated the framework code path that previously reached the buggy `loader_to_string` lambda). **Fix applied (path A from brief):** new production class `shim/java/com/westlake/services/ColdBootstrap.java` (~250 LOC) encapsulates the three plant operations (Unsafe.allocateInstance ActivityThread / mSystemContext = BootstrapContext(PE) / install as sCurrentActivityThread) behind an idempotent + thread-safe `ColdBootstrap.ensure()` entry point. `BootstrapContext` inner class moved from `CharsetPrimer`. `SystemServiceRouteTest.main()` now calls `ColdBootstrap.ensure()` reflectively (cross-package). `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread()` now delegates to `ColdBootstrap.ensure()` with a fallback to the legacy direct path for unbuilt shim/dex environments. No changes to `art-latest/*`, no PF-arch-055 patch needed. `aosp-shim.dex` rebuilt clean (1,386,128 bytes including new ColdBootstrap class). Full report: `aosp-libbinder-port/diagnostics/CR18_primer_sigbus_bisection.md`. |
| §47 | CR19 WestlakePackageManagerStub fail-loud | Codex review #2 Tier 2 finding: the LOCAL `Context.getPackageManager()` impl (`WestlakePackageManagerStub`, M4-PRE5) was created before CR2 established the fail-loud pattern and still had 168 non-Tier-1 method bodies returning `null` / `false` / `0` / empty silently — meaning Hilt-DI / AndroidX / app code could bypass the discovery signal by calling unobserved methods and getting wrong defaults. CR19 converts all 168 silent stubs to `throw ServiceMethodMissing.fail("packageManager", "<methodName>")` (same pattern as M4a/M4b/M4c/M4d/M4e/M4-power post-CR2). The 11 Tier-1 methods are preserved unchanged: `getServiceInfo`, `getActivityInfo`, `getApplicationInfo`, `getPackageInfo`, `hasSystemFeature(String)`, `hasSystemFeature(String,int)`, `resolveActivity`, `resolveService`, `queryIntentActivities`, `getInstalledPackages`, `checkPermission`. Since `ServiceMethodMissing.fail` returns an unchecked `UnsupportedOperationException`, methods declaring `throws NameNotFoundException` (checked) need no signature change. **Build**: `aosp-shim.dex` rebuilt clean (1,380,980 → 1,383,652 bytes, +2,672 B / +0.19% — fail-loud bodies are wider than 0/null/false returns). **Test**: quick regression suite is highly flaky on cfb7c9e3 (5 runs, 5 different failure patterns, none correlated to PackageManager methods); the failures rotate across sm_smoke / HelloBinder / SystemServiceRouteTest / InputMethodServiceTest / NotificationServiceTest / WindowServiceTest — many of which don't even exercise PackageManager — proving the flakiness is infrastructure, not CR19. Zero `WestlakeServiceMethodMissing` markers fired in any regression test, confirming the M4 service tests never depended on silently-null PM behavior. |
| §44 | CR15 PF-arch-054 widen-the-guard | **[SUPERSEDED-V2 + CR26 — V2 substrate sidesteps the PathClassLoader.toString call path that triggered this SIGBUS (V2 doesn't traverse `BaseDexClassLoader.toString` during Activity.attach since the call site was in the V1 discovery harness, not in V2 production code); the widened guard remains in source as dead-code documentation per the V2-Step7 audit. The underlying lambda was rewritten by CR26 (PF-arch-055) to bypass `env->functions` entirely. See §51 CR26 + §52 V2-Step7]** Applied the Tier-2 fix CR13 recommended: `loader_to_string` lambda at `art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc:2750-2767` now also rejects `kPFCutStaleNativeEntry` (`0xfffffffffffffb17`). Compiler emits `cmn x2, #1257; b.eq .ret_null` — verified by disassembly at `0x6744c4` to match the sentinel. dalvikvm rebuilt (-72 B; md5 `7546afc6...` → `807cf339...`), deployed to phone `cfb7c9e3`. **HelloBinder still PASS** (exit 0; smoke baselines preserved). **`noice-discover.sh` STILL SIGBUSes at the SAME fault addr `0xfffffffffffffb17` at PHASE B** — disproving CR13's hypothesis that `loader_to_string`'s `br x2` is the proximate fault site. The lambda now provably cannot branch to the sentinel (`cmn` test passes) yet the same fault still hits — meaning the actual `br/blr sentinel` is in ANOTHER native path entered during PathClassLoader's ctor flow. ~15 unguarded `[ldr x?, #1336; br/blr x?]` patterns remain in dalvikvm (search of disassembly: `0x4d1bf8` = `InvokeMain::$_13`/`nativeVmArg`; `0x674b58` = `Runtime::Start::$_68`/`empty_icu_path` — dead w/o env var; `0x7c64fc`, `0x7c6f40`, `0x7c6f54`, etc.). Open mystery from CR13 §6.3 (WHO writes the sentinel) remains the actual blocker. PHASE B is still the high-water mark. PHASE C/D/E/F/G NOT reached. CR17-class hw watchpoint on `0xfad8f8` (vaddr of `JNINativeInterface::NewStringUTF`) needed. |
| §49 | CR23-fix real-McD VM mainImpl past framework.jar BCP shift | **[SUPERSEDED-V2-Step6 — V2 owns `Activity.attach` via classpath shadow against framework.jar, so the `try { activity.attach(6 args) } catch (NoSuchMethodError | LinkageError)` + `mBase = ContextWrapper.class` reflective tolerance + `WestlakeActivityThread.buildBaseContext` fallback are deleted in V2-Step6. See §52 V2-Step6 + `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §7 Step 6 + `V2_STEP6_DIFF_SPEC.md`]** McD VM regression diagnosed; `WestlakeActivityThread.buildBaseContext` static + `publishApplicationToBaseContext` + tolerant attach wrap + ContextWrapper field-type fix landed. Regression went 14/14 PASS as a side-effect (noice's services.jar Guava collision cleared). McD VM reaches `McDMarketApplication.onCreate` but dashboard view does not attach because framework Activity's `mWindow` is null — V2-Step5's Window stubs now solve this. |
| §50 | CR27 `NoiceDiscoverWrapper` → manifest-driven `DiscoverWrapperBase` | `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` 1195 LOC → 60 LOC slim shim; new `DiscoverWrapperBase.java` (1140 LOC) reads per-app `.properties` manifest; new `McdDiscoverWrapper.java` (70 LOC); McD reaches PHASE G3 on first attempt. |
| §51 | CR26 substrate fix for PF-arch-054 sentinel SIGBUS (PF-arch-055) | Audited `art-latest/` and confirmed **no code writes the sentinel into `JNINativeInterface::NewStringUTF`**; the static `gJniNativeInterface` table is well-formed. On the failing path `env->functions` itself is corrupted. Rewrote patched `loader_to_string` lambda body to use `mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8` + `JNIEnvExt::AddLocalReference` — bypasses `env->functions` vtable entirely. dalvikvm rebuilt (md5 `c4ab142009d534fdf2b1b5b68fc2575c`). Regression: noice-discover PHASE A-G4 all reached with CR24 workaround reverted; full regression 14/14 PASS with CR24 retained as belt-and-suspenders. |
| §52 | V2 Substrate (V2-Step1..Step8-fix) | **CR28-architect's V2 design landed in 8 sub-steps over ~13h.** Substitution boundary moved from V1's "plant framework cold-init fields" approach (M4-PRE12/13/14, CR23-fix — all `[SUPERSEDED-V2]` above) to **classpath shadow against framework.jar at the `Activity.attach` / `Application.attach` / `Resources` / `Window` API surface** via `framework_duplicates.txt` comment-outs.

**Note on CR5:** The CR5 work-package was tracked under two names. The
"ContentResolver shim" piece (M4-PRE9's WestlakeContentResolver that
satisfied `Settings.Global.getInt`'s `cr.getUserId()` NPE) landed at
§27. The "registry wrap arms" piece (extending CR3/CR4's
SystemServiceWrapperRegistry to cover window/display/notification/
input_method binder-backed wraps) landed at §29. CR4's report had
queued both as a single CR5 milestone; in practice they were dispatched
as two separate artifacts by two different agents.

## TL;DR

* noice is **blocked before any binder transaction reaches an implementation**: the very first cause-of-failure is `Context.getPackageName()` returning null in Hilt's auto-generated DI bootstrap (`com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice.repository.p.<init>(Context)` → `m2.w.a(Context)` → `Context.getPackageName()` on a null `mBase`).
* That NPE is **not a binder problem**. It is a Context/ActivityThread plumbing problem: we have no real `ActivityThread`, no `ContextImpl`, and no Application has had `attach(Context)` called on it.
* Therefore **M4 implementation cannot start with service classes alone**. The critical-path prerequisite is **M4-PRE: minimal Context plumbing** (see §5).
* Once that prerequisite is in place, noice's expected binder service consumption is fairly modest — noice's own classes call `Context.getSystemService` on **22 service names**, none of them especially heavy. The framework-internal lookups expand that to ~30 services for the first frame.
* **Tier 1 (boot-blocking) Binder services for noice**: `activity`, `package`, `window`, `display`, `power`, `audio`, `notification`, `alarm`. The first 4 are required by AOSP `ActivityThread.handleBindApplication` / `ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity`; the latter 4 are required by noice's own code paths.
* **Estimated total person-days for M4a-e to satisfy noice's first frame**: ~12 days for one agent, ~3-4 calendar days for an agent swarm (assuming the M4-PRE Context work is treated as a separate prerequisite milestone).

## 1. Method

The discovery wrapper drives noice's bootstrap stages inside the M3 sandbox (dalvikvm + Westlake libbinder + Westlake servicemanager on `/dev/vndbinder`, framework.jar on `-Xbootclasspath`). Each stage is independently caught so a failure in one stage doesn't blind us to subsequent ones.

| Phase | What it does | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| A — probe | Call `ServiceManager.getService(name)` for 70 typical system service names | 0/70 found (expected: empty SM) |
| B — classload | Verify noice's APK classes load through `PathClassLoader` | 5/7 — `NoiceApplication`, `MainActivity`, `HomeFragment`, `ApplicationComponentManager`, `HiltAndroidApp` all loadable; the `Hilt_*` names don't exist because R8 inlined Hilt's parent class as `u3.l` |
| C — ctor | `NoiceApplication.<init>()` | PASS — class init + constructor both succeed |
| D — attach | `Application.attach(proxyContext)` | SKIPPED — couldn't synthesize a Context (Context is abstract, not interface; `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` rejects it) |
| E — onCreate | `NoiceApplication.onCreate()` | FAIL — NPE inside Hilt DI bootstrap before any binder lookup |
| F — Singletons | `ActivityManager.getService()`, `ActivityThread.getPackageManager()`, `WindowManagerGlobal.getWindowManagerService()`, `DisplayManagerGlobal.getInstance()`, `AudioSystem.getMasterMute()`, `IActivityManager.Stub.asInterface(null)`, `InputMethodManager` class probe | 5/6 framework Singletons return null cleanly. `AudioSystem.<clinit>` fails at `UnsatisfiedLinkError` for `native_getMaxChannelCount` (its JNI is in libaudioclient.so which we don't have) |

The `binder_jni_stub.cc` `nativeGetService(name)` is already instrumented (LOGI + stderr) — every lookup is observable. No additional dalvikvm instrumentation was added (the existing logs were sufficient).

---

## 2. Static use of system services in noice (smali analysis)

From `apktool d` on the noice APK followed by grep of `getSystemService(String)` call sites with surrounding `const-string` register loads. These are services noice's **own code** asks for — they are an upper bound on what M4 must satisfy for noice to function (not counting framework-internal lookups, see §3).

| Service name | Manager class noice receives | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `activity` | `ActivityManager` | (rare — process info) |
| `alarm` | `AlarmManager` | Scheduled sleep timer + `AlarmInitReceiver` boot init |
| `appops` | `AppOpsManager` | Microphone/storage perms checks |
| `accessibility` | `AccessibilityManager` | Talkback compatibility |
| `audio` | `AudioManager` | Volume control, audio focus |
| `captioning` | `CaptioningManager` | Subtitles/CC for streamed audio |
| `clipboard` | `ClipboardManager` | Copy preset URL |
| `connectivity` | `ConnectivityManager` | Network change broadcasts |
| `display` | `DisplayManager` | Sleep/wake detection |
| `input_method` | `InputMethodManager` | Soft keyboard show/hide |
| `jobscheduler` | `JobScheduler` | Background download jobs |
| `layout_inflater` | `LayoutInflater` | View inflation (process-local, NOT binder) |
| `location` | `LocationManager` | (probably IAP geo-region — likely unused at boot) |
| `media_metrics` | `MediaMetricsManager` | Playback analytics |
| `media_session` | `MediaSessionManager` | Now-playing notification on lock screen |
| `notification` | `NotificationManager` | Sleep timer notification, playback notification |
| `phone` | `TelephonyManager` | Incoming-call audio ducking |
| `power` | `PowerManager` | `WakeLock` while playing |
| `uimode` | `UiModeManager` | Light/dark theme |
| `vibrator` | `Vibrator` | Tactile feedback on button press |
| `wifi` | `WifiManager` | Pause downloads on metered networks |
| `window` | `WindowManager` | View attach (via Activity) |

Additionally, noice calls `getSystemService(Class)` for:
* `AppOpsManager`
* `UserManager`
* `AutofillManager`
* `TextClassificationManager`

---

## 3. Framework-internal services touched (PHASE F + dependencies)

Even without a Context, AOSP framework code reached the following binder lookups (observed in PHASE F):

| Service | Caller | Code path |
|---|---|---|
| `activity` | `ActivityManager.IActivityManagerSingleton.create()` | `IActivityManager am = IActivityManager.Stub.asInterface(ServiceManager.getService("activity"))` |
| `package` | `ActivityThread.getPackageManager()` | `sPackageManager = IPackageManager.Stub.asInterface(ServiceManager.getService("package"))` |
| `window` | `WindowManagerGlobal.getWindowManagerService()` | `sWindowManagerService = IWindowManager.Stub.asInterface(ServiceManager.getService("window"))` |
| `display` | `DisplayManagerGlobal.getInstance()` | Looks up `display` then registers a callback (would call `IDisplayManager.registerCallbackWithEventMask` once a binder is returned) |

Static singletons in framework.jar that we did NOT exercise but the noice startup path probably will trigger (sequence inferred from AOSP's `ActivityThread.handleBindApplication`):

* `notification` (NotificationManager getter)
* `permissionmgr` (PermissionManager constructor)
* `appops` (AppOpsManager constructor)
* `power` (PowerManager constructor)
* `permission` (legacy PermissionController)

---

## 4. The single observed app-side failure

```
java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke InvokeType(2) method
  'java.lang.String android.content.Context.getPackageName()' on a null object reference
   #0 android.content.ContextWrapper.getPackageName() (dex_pc=2)
   #1 m2.w.a(android.content.Context) (dex_pc=5)
   #2 com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice.repository.p.<init>(android.content.Context) (dex_pc=5)
   #3 u3.h.get() (dex_pc=695)        // Hilt-generated provider
   #4 z6.a.get() (dex_pc=13)         // Dagger Provider.get()
   #5 u3.l.onCreate()                // Hilt_NoiceApplication.onCreate
   #6 com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice.NoiceApplication.onCreate()
```

Decoding the obfuscation:
* `u3.l` = `Hilt_NoiceApplication` (Hilt's `@HiltAndroidApp` generated parent for `NoiceApplication`).
* `m2.w.a(Context)` = a Hilt-generated helper that derives a string from `Context.getPackageName()` (probably a `@PackageName` provider).
* `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice.repository.p` = a Hilt-injected repository (named `p` post-R8; likely the SettingsRepository or PresetRepository, judging from the Context dependency).

The chain is fundamentally a **Context plumbing problem**: noice expects `Application.attach(Context)` to have been called by `ActivityThread.handleBindApplication` and to have set up `mBase` to a non-null `ContextImpl`. Our wrapper bypasses that and the symptom is precisely the absence of `mBase`.

---

## 5. M4-PRE — Minimum Context plumbing (new dependency)

Before any M4 service can be tested against noice, we need a minimum amount of Context plumbing. This is **not** a binder service; it's framework-internal Java state. Three options, ordered from least to most work:

### 5a) Minimal ContextWrapper subclass (S — 1 day)

Write `WestlakeMinimalContext extends Context` (full abstract impl with 148 methods) returning sensible defaults: package name, opPackageName, classloader, mainLooper, working in-memory SharedPreferences, throwing `UnsupportedOperationException` for harder methods (file/db, system service, content resolver).

Call `Application.attach(WestlakeMinimalContext)` reflectively before `onCreate`.

**Pros:** small, immediate, fits in one file. **Cons:** noice's first attempt to `getSystemService("audio")` etc. would land in UnsupportedOperationException rather than reaching binder. Requires per-method intercept logic to forward `getSystemService` to the M4 service binders.

### 5b) Synthesize a real ContextImpl (M — 2-3 days)

Build a minimal `ActivityThread` instance + `LoadedApk` + `ContextImpl.createAppContext(thread, loadedApk)`. This is closer to what AOSP does in `ActivityThread.handleBindApplication`.

**Pros:** noice gets a real Context with real `Resources`, real `SharedPreferences`, real `getSystemService`. **Cons:** ActivityThread/LoadedApk are heavyweight — `LoadedApk` needs `IPackageManager.getApplicationInfo` (Tier-1 service), so this requires a partial M4c implementation first.

### 5c) Drive ActivityThread.main() in a child thread (L — 4-5 days)

Replicate the AOSP system-server boot of an app: `ActivityThread.main()` opens a binder thread, waits for `IActivityManager.attachApplication(thread, startSeq)`. We'd then need our `WestlakeActivityManagerService` to call back into `thread.scheduleCreateService` / `scheduleLaunchActivity` to drive the activity lifecycle.

**Pros:** the canonical Android-launch flow; once working, every app should boot the same way. **Cons:** very large change — basically replicates the full M4-A1 milestone.

**Recommendation: M4-PRE = option (5a) first**, with a built-in `getSystemService` switch that forwards to the M4 services as they come online. Switch to (5b) once IPackageManager is functional enough to support `LoadedApk`.

---

## 6. Ranked priority list

### Tier 1 — blocks noice's Application.onCreate / first ActivityThread.bind

| # | Service | AOSP class | Why blocking | AIDL source | Est. effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | M4-PRE | Context plumbing (not a binder service) | NPE on getPackageName before any binder reached | n/a | S — 1 day |
| 2 | `activity` | `IActivityManager` | Singleton used by `Context.sendBroadcast`/`startActivity`/`bindService`; noice's onCreate `sendBroadcast(AlarmInitReceiver init intent)` | `frameworks/base/core/java/android/app/IActivityManager.aidl` (173 methods) | M — 2 days, ~15 methods needed |
| 3 | `package` | `IPackageManager` | `ActivityThread.getPackageManager()` is called during `LoadedApk` resolution and by Hilt's R-class-resource lookups | `frameworks/base/core/java/android/content/pm/IPackageManager.aidl` (~250 methods) | M — 1.5 days, ~10 methods needed |
| 4 | `window` | `IWindowManager` | First `setContentView` flushes through `ViewRootImpl` → `IWindowSession` (a `IWindowManager`-issued session) | `frameworks/base/core/java/android/view/IWindowManager.aidl` (~100 methods) + `IWindowSession.aidl` | L — 3 days (also needs IWindowSession + SurfaceControl plumbing) |
| 5 | `display` | `IDisplayManager` | `DisplayManagerGlobal.getInstance().getDisplayInfo(...)` is called by `ViewRootImpl` and by `Resources` for density | `frameworks/base/core/java/android/hardware/display/IDisplayManager.aidl` (~30 methods) | S — 0.5 day, 4 methods needed |
| 6 | `power` | `IPowerManager` | `PowerManager.WakeLock.acquire/release` is called during audio playback start/stop | `frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/IPowerManager.aidl` | S — 0.5 day, 3 methods needed |

### Tier 2 — blocks first interactive frame (after onCreate)

| # | Service | AOSP class | Why | Est. effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | `permissionmgr` | `IPermissionManager` | `PermissionManager` ctor in `ContextImpl.getSystemService` | S — 0.5 day, 2 methods (just probe queries) |
| 8 | `appops` | `IAppOpsService` | noice's `AppOpsManager` check on first audio playback (for `OP_PLAY_AUDIO`) | S — 0.5 day |
| 9 | `notification` | `INotificationManager` | Sleep-timer notification, playback notification — required for foreground service. Also `notifyAsUser`. | M — 1 day, ~6 methods |
| 10 | `input_method` | `IInputMethodManager` | First focus on `EditText` (preset name input) — keyboard show | M — 1 day, ~5 methods |
| 11 | `audio` | `IAudioService` (Java) + `media.audio_flinger` (native) | Tap-a-sound playback. AudioManager.requestAudioFocus → AudioService.requestAudioFocus → real binder | L — 3 days (or **defer to M5 audio daemon**) |

### Tier 3 — blocks specific UI/UX features but not boot

* `connectivity`, `wifi` — noice's "metered network" pause-downloads check. Defer; noice tolerates null.
* `alarm` — noice's `AlarmInitReceiver` registers wake alarms at boot. Defer; the boot intent broadcast can be a no-op until Tier-1 IActivityManager.broadcastIntent works.
* `media_session`, `media_metrics`, `media_router` — Now-Playing notification on lock screen + playback analytics. Defer to M6/M16.
* `phone` — Incoming-call audio ducking. Defer; defensive against null.
* `uimode`, `vibrator`, `clipboard`, `captioning`, `accessibility` — feature-specific. Defer.
* `usagestats`, `jobscheduler` — Background scheduling. Defer.

### Out of scope for M4 (covered by other Mxs or future work)

* `media.audio_flinger`, `media.audio_policy` → M5 (westlake-audio-daemon)
* `SurfaceFlinger` → M6 (westlake-surface-daemon)
* `media`, `media.player`, `media_router_service`, `media.extractor` → M16 (media daemon)
* `gpu`, `GpuService`, `graphicsstats` → tied to M6 + Phase 3
* `webviewupdate` → M14 (only needed if app uses WebView; noice doesn't on its hot path)
* `wifi`, `connectivity`, `telephony.registry` → defer; noice tolerates null

---

## 7. Transaction codes per Tier-1 service (initial inventory)

This is the next layer of detail: which specific methods on each `IXxxService.Stub` does noice's first-frame flow actually call. Transaction codes here are AOSP Android 11 (matching the framework.jar we ship); newer Androids may renumber. Confirmation requires either:
1. Implementing a `WestlakeXxxService.Stub` with `onTransact` instrumentation that logs every code, OR
2. Reading `out/soong/.intermediates/...gen/aidl/...Stub.java` and counting `TRANSACTION_xxx = (FIRST_CALL_TRANSACTION + N)` constants.

The numbered codes below are guesstimates from AIDL declaration order in `IActivityManager.aidl` line scan; **the agent implementing each M4 sub-milestone should re-derive these from the generated Stub.java in framework.jar via Java reflection on the Stub class — that's authoritative**.

### `IActivityManager` — Tier-1, ~10-15 methods needed

| Method | Reason needed | Estimated complexity |
|---|---|---|
| `attachApplication(IApplicationThread, long)` | Each app process calls this in `ActivityThread.handleBindApplication`'s prologue. We may need it iff we drive M4-PRE option (5c). | Medium — touches IApplicationThread callback wiring |
| `broadcastIntentWithFeature(...)` or older `broadcastIntent(...)` | noice's `NoiceApplication.onCreate` calls `sendBroadcast(intent for AlarmInitReceiver)` | Medium — most apps register receivers via this, can no-op for now |
| `startActivity(...)` / `startActivityWithFeature(...)` | When noice launches a Preset detail activity, or external Intent.VIEW. Out of scope for first frame. | Defer to Tier-2 |
| `registerReceiverWithFeature(...)` | Hilt + AndroidX call this often during boot | Medium |
| `getCurrentUser()` / `getUidForIntentSender(...)` | Hilt's process-local cache. | Trivial (return 0) |
| `getMyMemoryState(MemoryInfo)` | App-side memory dumps; rarely called early. | Trivial |
| `unregisterReceiver(IIntentReceiver)` | Symmetric pair of registerReceiver. | Trivial |
| `bindIsolatedService` / `bindService` | If noice uses `MediaBrowserService` (it does for media notification). | Medium |
| `getServices(int, int)` / `getRunningServices(int)` | Defer |
| `getPackageProcessState(String, String)` | Defensive probe | Trivial |

### `IPackageManager` — Tier-1, ~10 methods needed

| Method | Reason |
|---|---|
| `getApplicationInfo(String pkgName, int flags, int userId)` | First-frame: `LoadedApk` needs the AppInfo for noice itself |
| `getPackageInfo(String pkgName, int flags, int userId)` | Hilt queries `getPackageInfo(GET_META_DATA)` for app metadata |
| `resolveIntent(Intent, String resolveType, int flags, int userId)` | When sendBroadcast resolves which receivers exist |
| `queryIntentActivities(...)` | Activity launches |
| `queryBroadcastReceivers(...)` | noice's `sendBroadcast(AlarmInitReceiver init)` |
| `getInstalledApplications(int flags, int userId)` | Hilt sometimes scans installed apps — defensive |
| `getActivityInfo(ComponentName, int flags, int userId)` | When framework needs the noice main Activity's ActivityInfo |
| `getReceiverInfo(ComponentName, int, int)` | symmetric of getActivityInfo for receivers |
| `getProvidersForAuthority(String, int)` | Hilt's WorkManager uses content providers |
| `hasSystemFeature(String, int)` | Routinely called for hardware-availability tests |

### `IWindowManager` — Tier-1, requires `IWindowSession` too

| Method | Reason |
|---|---|
| `openSession(IWindowSessionCallback, IInputMethodClient, IInputContext)` | First Activity creates a `WindowSession`. This is the heaviest method — it returns an `IWindowSession` which then handles `addToDisplay`, `relayout`, `finishDrawing`. |
| `getDefaultDisplaySize(Point)` | `Resources.updateConfiguration` calls this |
| `useBLAST()` / `isLowRamDevice()` | Defensive probes; can return false |
| `getCurrentImeTouchRegion()` | IME-related; not needed for first frame |
| `getDisplayContentInfo(int)` | DisplayManagerGlobal cross-references |

**Note**: `IWindowSession` is most of the work — `addToDisplay`, `relayout`, `finishDrawing` are the per-window methods that drive the BufferQueue and surface composition. This is the M4b + M6 (surface daemon) interface boundary.

### `IDisplayManager` — Tier-1, 4 methods

| Method | Reason |
|---|---|
| `getDisplayInfo(int displayId)` | `DisplayManagerGlobal.getRealDisplay(...).getDisplayInfo(...)` — returns DisplayInfo with size/density/refresh-rate |
| `getDisplayIds()` | Listed for multi-display apps; noice doesn't need it but framework's `Display.DEFAULT_DISPLAY` lookup triggers it |
| `registerCallbackWithEventMask(IDisplayManagerCallback, long eventMask)` | DisplayListener subscription |
| `getStableDisplaySize()` | Called by `ViewRootImpl` for stable insets |

### `IPowerManager` — Tier-1, 3 methods

| Method | Reason |
|---|---|
| `acquireWakeLock(IBinder lock, int flags, String tag, String packageName, WorkSource ws, String historyTag)` | noice's audio playback acquires PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK |
| `releaseWakeLock(IBinder lock, int flags)` | Symmetric pair |
| `isInteractive()` | Tested by playback service to honor screen-off |

## 8. Reproduction & how to extend

### To re-run discovery on the current sandbox

```bash
# Build
bash $HOME/android-to-openharmony-migration/aosp-libbinder-port/build_discover.sh

# Push (if any artifact changed)
ADB="/mnt/c/Users/dspfa/Dev/platform-tools/adb.exe -H localhost -P 5037 -s cfb7c9e3"
$ADB push aosp-libbinder-port/out/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex /data/local/tmp/westlake/dex/
$ADB push aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover.sh /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/

# Run
$ADB shell "su -c 'cd /data/local/tmp/westlake && bash bin-bionic/noice-discover.sh'"
```

### To extend the discovery surface (add a service to PHASE A or a new Singleton to PHASE F)

Edit `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java`:
* Add to `PROBE_SERVICES` for a simple name probe.
* Add a new `try { ... } catch(...)` block in `phaseF_frameworkSingletons()` for a new framework singleton.

### To instrument transactions on a specific service after M4 implementation begins

The pattern in `art-latest/stubs/binder_jni_stub.cc` `Java_android_os_ServiceManager_nativeGetService` is to LOGI the lookup. For received transactions on a registered Java service, override `BBinder::onTransact` in the registered Stub and `LOGI("transact: code=%d", code)` before delegating. The first ~20 transactions noice's bootstrap fires after Tier-1 services exist will identify the must-implement methods.

## 9. Estimates summary

| Milestone | Method count needed | Effort (solo) | Effort (swarm parallel) |
|---|---|---|---|
| M4-PRE Context plumbing (option 5a) | n/a | 1 day | 1 day |
| M4a `IActivityManager` (Tier-1 subset) | ~15 | 2 days | 2 days |
| M4b `IWindowManager` + `IWindowSession` | ~10 + ~12 | 3 days | 3 days |
| M4c `IPackageManager` (Tier-1 subset) | ~10 | 1.5 days | 1.5 days |
| M4d `IDisplayManager` | 4 | 0.5 day | 0.5 day |
| M4e `INotificationManager` + `IInputMethodManager` | 6+5 | 2 days | 1 day (split across 2 agents) |
| M4-power `IPowerManager` | 3 | 0.5 day | 0.5 day |
| **Total Tier-1+2 for first frame** | ~65 methods | ~10.5 days | ~3-4 days |

**Notes on swarm parallelization**:
* M4-PRE must come first (~1 day).
* M4a, M4c, M4d, M4-power, M4e can all run in parallel (5 agents).
* M4b is bottleneck (3 days, but depends on M4d).
* Total wall-clock for the critical path: M4-PRE (1d) → max(M4b 3d) = 4 days.

## 10. Open questions and follow-ups for the next discovery iteration

1. **Hilt class generation strategy** — `Hilt_NoiceApplication` doesn't exist as a class in the APK. R8 has fused it as `u3.l`. We need to verify that AOSP's Hilt-aware ContextWrapper still works post-R8 fusion, or if Hilt at compile-time expects specific class names that R8 rewriting breaks. (Unlikely to be a problem for production noice, but worth noting.)
2. **What does noice's `AlarmInitReceiver` do?** The `sendBroadcast` in `onCreate` is the first IActivityManager.broadcastIntent. Decompile the receiver to see what handler runs.
3. **Hilt component graph** — `repository.p.<init>(Context)` is the first Hilt-injected member to fail. There are probably 30-50 more `@Inject` constructors in noice's graph. Each needs to succeed without service lookups for boot to proceed past the Hilt component. Once we have a working Context, we should re-run discovery and trace Hilt's first 10 `@Provides` returns.
4. **`AudioSystem.<clinit>` UnsatisfiedLinkError** — `AudioSystem` is a framework.jar static class with 100% native methods. We'll need to either (a) skip its `<clinit>` (`-Xverify:none` doesn't help; need a stub libaudioclient_stub.so), or (b) implement enough of `AudioSystem`'s natives that `<clinit>` completes. The latter is a prerequisite for M5 audio daemon.
5. **W2-discover wrapper limitations** — Cannot synthesize a Context dynamically (Context is abstract, not interface). For deeper discovery the wrapper needs a concrete `WestlakeMinimalContext` class in `aosp-shim.dex`. Tracked as M4-PRE.

---

## 11. Pointers to follow-on work

* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` — re-runnable harness, extend as needed.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover.sh` — boot script.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/build_discover.sh` — dex builder.
* `art-latest/stubs/binder_jni_stub.cc` — diagnostic logging is already in place (LOGI in nativeGetService); keep, do not remove.
* `BINDER_PIVOT_MILESTONES.md` §M4 — updated to reference this doc.

## 12. Post-M4-PRE re-discovery (2026-05-12 evening)

After M4-PRE landed (`shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java`,
628 LOC; reflective wiring in `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java`) and the
discovery harness was re-run, noice progressed further. The mBase
NullPointerException is gone.

### 12.1 What now works

* PHASE D — `Application.attachBaseContext(WestlakeContextImpl)` succeeds.
  `Application.getPackageName()` post-attach returns `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice`.
* PHASE E — `NoiceApplication.onCreate()` runs through `Hilt_NoiceApplication.onCreate()`
  (`u3.l.onCreate`) past the `repository.p.<init>(Context)` site that
  previously NPE'd. The NPE on `Context.getPackageName()` is no longer
  the failure mode.

### 12.2 The new failure point (NOT a Context plumbing gap, NOT a binder gap)

```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
  No InvokeType(0) method h(Lz6/b;)Lcom/google/common/collect/ImmutableMap;
  in class Lcom/google/common/collect/ImmutableMap; or its super classes
  (declaration of 'com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap' appears in
   /data/local/tmp/westlake/services.jar!classes3.dex)
```

**Diagnosis:** classpath collision between noice's bundled Guava and
`services.jar`'s bundled Guava. Noice's R8-shrunk Hilt graph references
`ImmutableMap.h(z6.b)` — an obfuscated method name introduced by R8's
rewriting of Guava during noice's build. At runtime the boot classloader
(which now includes `services.jar` on BCP) wins for `com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap`,
so noice's Guava classes inside the APK are shadowed.

This is **not a binder problem and not a Context plumbing problem**. It is a
classloader-resolution problem rooted in services.jar's presence on the
boot classpath. Options:

1. **(Recommended)** Remove `services.jar` from the discover-script BCP.
   The framework-internal services need `services.jar` at runtime *somewhere*,
   but noice's process should not have it — Android's real launch path
   puts `services.jar` only in system_server, not in app processes. Doing
   this is one line in `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover.sh`.
2. Use `PathClassLoader`'s isolation mode (Android-specific) so the APK's
   own classes win against the boot classloader.
3. Re-pack noice's APK to remove the shaded Guava (heavyweight; not for
   sandbox).

Option 1 is the right move for the next discovery iteration. It also
prepares the boot path for real Android app processes (which do not see
services.jar).

### 12.3 What changed in M4-PRE

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java` (NEW) | 628 | Min Context impl; thoughtful real impls for `getPackageName`, `getApplicationInfo`, `getClassLoader`, `getResources`, `getTheme`, `getMainLooper`, `getApplicationContext`, `getDataDir`/`getFilesDir`/`getCacheDir`, `getFileStreamPath`, `getSharedPreferencesPath`, file I/O; safe-default (null/0/false/no-op) stubs for the other ~110 Context methods. No per-app branches: packageName / apkPath / dataDir / targetSdk are constructor args. |
| `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` (UPDATED) | +37 / -13 | `buildProxyContext()` now reflectively constructs `WestlakeContextImpl` from `aosp-shim.dex`. `phaseDE_attachAndOnCreate()` now uses `Application.attachBaseContext(Context)` via reflection (the lower-level protected method on ContextWrapper) instead of `Application.attach(Context)` — `attach()` would ClassCastException at `ContextImpl.getImpl(context)` because our impl is not a `ContextImpl`. |
| `aosp-libbinder-port/M4_PRE_NOTES.md` (NEW) | n/a | Implementation rationale + dispatch decision. |

### 12.4 Which Context methods were actually called?

From the Hilt DI bootstrap up to (and past) the
`repository.p.<init>(Context)` site, the only observed call was
`Context.getPackageName()` (still the very first one). The
`NoSuchMethodError` on `ImmutableMap.h()` happens BEFORE Hilt's DI gets
to its second Context call. So only ONE method on `WestlakeContextImpl`
was actually exercised during this re-discovery: `getPackageName()`.

**This validates the "implement only what's observed needed" principle**:
the 628 LOC are 90%+ safe-default stubs because we wrote out every Context
abstract method preemptively to satisfy the JVM's "is the class
instantiable" check at allocation time. The 10% that are real impls only
needed to be a small handful in practice (packageName + classloader +
applicationInfo, give or take). Future M4-PRE2 may revisit by extending
`ContextWrapper` over a stripped-down delegate base instead of writing
all 131 method bodies.

### 12.5 Recommendation on next dispatch order

Given the new failure point is **not in the Tier-1 binder service list**:

1. **First**: fix the services.jar/Guava classpath collision (1-2 hours
   work; almost certainly just removing `:$DIR/services.jar` from
   `BCP=` in `noice-discover.sh`). Re-run discovery. If noice progresses,
   the next failure becomes the M4 dispatch target.
2. **Second** (parallel to #1): start M4a (`IActivityManager` Tier-1
   subset) and M4-power (`IPowerManager`) since these are
   high-confidence smaller services that Hilt-DI'd repositories often
   call during boot. These are also the highest-likelihood next failure
   points after Guava is fixed.
3. **Defer until services.jar issue resolved**: M4b (`IWindowManager` +
   `IWindowSession`), M4c (`IPackageManager`). These are larger surfaces
   and lower-priority until we know what binder transactions noice
   actually fires after Hilt DI completes.

The W2-discover summary's Tier-1 ranking (activity / package / window /
display / power) stands. What changes is the *order*:

> **Updated dispatch order:** services.jar/Guava classpath fix (1-2h) →
> M4-power (0.5d) + M4a Tier-1 subset (2d) in parallel → next discovery
> iteration → then M4c (IPackageManager) and M4d (IDisplayManager) once
> we see them needed → M4b last (heaviest, needs surface daemon hooks).

### 12.6 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| WestlakeContextImpl loadable & instantiable | PASS — `built WestlakeContextImpl: com.westlake.services.WestlakeContextImpl@8db5f6a` |
| Application.attachBaseContext(westlakeContext) succeeds | PASS |
| Application.getPackageName() returns real value | PASS — `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice` |
| Hilt DI bootstrap progresses past the original NPE site | PASS — `u3.l.onCreate` proceeds and fails at a different point (ImmutableMap.h, classpath issue) |
| `repository.p.<init>(Context)` does NOT throw NPE on getPackageName | PASS (no NPE in this iteration; the new failure is a `NoSuchMethodError` farther into Hilt's graph build) |

M4-PRE is the gating prerequisite for M4a-e, and it is now complete.

## 13. Post-M4-PRE2 re-discovery (2026-05-12 night)

After M4-PRE2 stripped `services.jar` from the discovery-script bootclasspath
(`aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover.sh` line 91 — the only line
changed; harness binary not rebuilt), the re-discovery was re-run:

```
$ADB shell "su -c 'bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/noice-discover.sh'" \
    | tee /tmp/noice-discover-postM4PRE2.log
```

**Outcome category: (a) — `NoiceApplication.onCreate()` completed without
throwing and without firing any Binder transaction.** This is a much
larger leap forward than expected.

### 13.1 What changed at the BCP layer

The discovery BCP is now:

```
core-oj.jar : core-libart.jar : core-icu4j.jar : bouncycastle.jar
            : aosp-shim.dex   : framework.jar : ext.jar
```

i.e. **no `services.jar`**. This matches AOSP's real app-process launch
path: `app_process` only puts `framework.jar` + `ext.jar` (and
mainline-module jars) on BCP via the `BOOTCLASSPATH` env var derived from
`/system/etc/classpaths/bootclasspath.pb`; `services.jar` is loaded
exclusively by `system_server` (see `frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/SystemServer.java` and
`/system/etc/init/services.rc`'s `service system_server` line which sets
its own classpath). Putting `services.jar` on an app's BCP is wrong on
multiple levels (and was the cause of M4-PRE's Guava classpath
collision).

### 13.2 Phase-by-phase result of re-discovery

| Phase | Pre-M4-PRE2 result (services.jar on BCP) | Post-M4-PRE2 result (services.jar off BCP) |
|---|---|---|
| A — probe | 0 / 70 services found (expected) | 0 / 70 services found (expected) |
| B — classload | 5/7 noice classes loadable (Hilt_* still NCDFE because R8 inlined them) | 5/7 noice classes loadable (same) |
| C — ctor | `NoiceApplication.<init>()` OK | OK |
| D — attach | `Application.attachBaseContext(WestlakeContextImpl)` OK | OK |
| E — onCreate | **FAIL** — `NoSuchMethodError: ImmutableMap.h(z6.b)` (Guava classpath collision) | **PASS** — `onCreate() returned cleanly` |
| F — Singletons | 5/6 OK; AudioSystem.getMasterMute → `UnsatisfiedLinkError` (libaudioclient.so) | Same: 5/6 OK; AudioSystem.getMasterMute → `UnsatisfiedLinkError` |

The Guava classpath collision (M4-PRE §12.2) is **gone**.

### 13.3 An unexpected observation about PHASE E

The PHASE E log region is *just two lines*:

```
PHASE E: calling NoiceApplication.onCreate()
PHASE E: onCreate() returned cleanly (unexpected!)
```

No `WLK-binder-jni` lookups, no PFCUT class-load traces, no AOSP framework
verbose output. The Hilt DI graph build that previously threw on
`ImmutableMap.h` is no longer being entered.

**Two non-exclusive hypotheses for why:**

1. **Hilt's actual DI graph build is lazy** — `u3.l.onCreate()` (Hilt's
   generated parent) does `super.onCreate(); if (!injected) { injected =
   true; ((Inject*)generatedComponent()).injectNoiceApplication(this); }`.
   The first call to `generatedComponent()` is what enters the Dagger /
   Guava-heavy code. If `generatedComponent()` is itself wrapped in a
   lazy initializer (`Lazy<ApplicationComponent>`), then the
   `onCreate()` call returns without ever entering the graph build. The
   graph would then build on the first `@Inject` field access at
   Activity / Fragment / Service instantiation time.
2. **The previous failure was at clinit, not invoke time** — when
   services.jar was on BCP, *its* `com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap`
   class won boot classloader resolution. Noice's code referenced
   `ImmutableMap.h(z6.b)` symbolically; the JIT/quickening linker
   resolved the reference against AOSP's stock Guava (which has no `h`
   method) and threw `NoSuchMethodError` at the *first* call site inside
   `u3.l.onCreate()`. After removing services.jar, the symbolic
   reference resolves to noice's bundled (R8-shrunk) Guava in the APK's
   own dex, where `h(z6.b)` does exist — and the call now succeeds.
   That, combined with #1's laziness, means `onCreate()` finishes its
   non-DI-graph work and returns.

Both are plausible and don't need to be untangled now — the discovery
*moved on*.

### 13.4 What this means for binder service discovery

`Application.onCreate()` is **not the place** where noice issues binder
transactions. The W2-discover §1 hypothesis that "Hilt wakes up here and
starts touching dozens of services" turns out to be wrong for this
particular app — at least for the `onCreate()` entry point.

Noice's binder transactions will come from:
- `ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity` → `Activity.<init>` → `Activity.attach(Context)` → `Activity.onCreate` → first `@Inject` field access
- Framework-internal Singletons (`ActivityManager`, `WindowManager`,
  `PowerManager`, ...) instantiated as a side effect of Activity launch
- Layout inflation, theme resolution, and resource lookups during
  `setContentView()` — these hit `IPackageManager` and `IDisplayManager`

**To find the next failure mode, the harness must drive MainActivity
launch.** That requires:
- A working `ActivityThread`-like driver to call `Activity.attach(...)`
- A real or stub `Instrumentation`
- A working `Context.getResources()` / `Context.getTheme()` (currently
  stubbed in WestlakeContextImpl)
- An `IBinder` for the activity record (`ActivityClientRecord` /
  `IApplicationThread` plumbing)

This is much heavier than M4-PRE was — it is effectively building a
miniature ActivityThread. See §13.6 below for the M4-PRE3 proposal.

### 13.5 PHASE F findings (recap, unchanged from W2-discover §1)

PHASE F drives 6 AOSP framework Singletons. Results post-M4-PRE2:

| Singleton | Result |
|---|---|
| `ActivityManager.getService()` | returns `null` (no binder reachable on `activity`) |
| `ActivityThread.getPackageManager()` | returns `null` |
| `WindowManagerGlobal.getWindowManagerService()` | returns `null` |
| `DisplayManagerGlobal.getInstance()` | returns `null` |
| `AudioSystem.<clinit>` then `getMasterMute()` | `UnsatisfiedLinkError` on `native_getMaxChannelCount` (libaudioclient.so absent) |
| `InputMethodManager` class probe | class loadable, no binder issued |

Of these, the four that return null cleanly indicate the framework code
gracefully handles `ServiceManager.getService(name)` returning null. The
binder lookups for `activity` / `package` / `window` / `display` *do*
fire (as `WLK-binder-jni: nativeGetService("name") -> 0x0` lines in the
log) — those are the exact four services that M4a-d will need to
register.

### 13.6 Outcome interpretation: this is category (a), and M4 service
implementation is no longer the **next** thing

The brief's three outcomes were:

> (a) noice's Application.onCreate completes → discovery progresses to MainActivity launch.
> (b) noice fails on a real Binder transaction.
> (c) noice fails on another plumbing gap.

This is **(a)**. Application.onCreate completed. But the natural
inference — "let's just dispatch M4a now" — is wrong, because **noice
hasn't *needed* M4a yet**. The next gate is **MainActivity launch**, and
that needs harness work (a mini-ActivityThread), not service work.

The pragmatic options:

- **Option 1: Extend `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` with PHASE G —
  MainActivity instantiation + onCreate drive.** This is M4-PRE3. It
  builds a stub `Instrumentation.newActivity()` path that mirrors
  `ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity` minus the IPC. Expected
  surface: `Activity.attach()` (very different signature from
  `Application.attach()`), `Context.getResources()` (needs real impl in
  `WestlakeContextImpl`), `Context.getTheme()`, `LayoutInflater.from()`.
  Probably 1-3 days of harness + Context work.

- **Option 2: Dispatch M4a/M4-power *speculatively*** based on the §1
  static analysis (services noice's source code references), and verify
  them with a synthetic test (e.g. `IPowerManager` newWakeLock from a
  binder smoke test in dalvikvm) rather than via noice's actual
  bootstrap. This is faster (parallel agent work) but doesn't validate
  the path noice takes — it validates a hypothetical.

- **Option 3: Both 1 and 2 in parallel.** Recommended.

### 13.7 Updated dispatch recommendation

Given M4-PRE2's empirical finding that Application.onCreate does NOT fire
binder transactions for noice, the previous "M4-power first, M4a next"
ordering is unchanged in priority but the **first action item** changes:

| Agent / milestone | Status after M4-PRE2 | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **M4-PRE3 — mini-ActivityThread + MainActivity launch driver** | NEW prerequisite uncovered | DISPATCH IMMEDIATELY. 1-3 days. Extends `NoiceDiscoverWrapper` with PHASE G that calls `Instrumentation.newActivity()` → `Activity.attach()` → `Activity.onCreate()`. Will surface the *real* binder gaps. Needs additional Context surface (`getResources`, `getTheme`, possibly `getSystemService` returning stubs). |
| **M4-power — `IPowerManager`** | unblocked; high speculative confidence (used by noice's media-session code path and by Activity.onCreate's wake-lock acquisition) | DISPATCH IN PARALLEL with M4-PRE3. ~0.5 days. The 5-6 high-likelihood transactions are `newWakeLock`, `acquireWakeLock`, `releaseWakeLock`, `isInteractive`, `getCurrentBrightness`. Verify with a binder smoke test in dalvikvm; do not wait for noice to demand them. |
| **M4a — `IActivityManager` Tier-1 subset** | unblocked; high speculative confidence | DISPATCH IN PARALLEL with M4-PRE3. ~2 days. Required transactions: `getIntentForIntentSender`, `startActivity` (no-op return BAD_VALUE acceptable for now), `getRunningAppProcesses`, `registerProcessObserver` (no-op), `getCurrentUser` (return 0). Verify with synthetic test. |
| **M4b — `IWindowManager` + `IWindowSession`** | hold | DEFER until M4-PRE3 confirms noice's Activity needs it (very likely, but specifics depend on which Activity APIs noice's MainActivity touches first). |
| **M4c — `IPackageManager`** | hold | DEFER. Will be needed by `Context.getResources()` / layout inflation, which M4-PRE3 will surface. |
| **M4d — `IDisplayManager`** | hold | DEFER. Likely needed by `Display.getRealMetrics()` during layout. M4-PRE3 will tell us. |
| **M4e — `INotificationManager` + `IInputMethodManager`** | hold | DEFER until noice's MediaSessionService / foreground-notification flow is exercised. |
| **M5 — westlake-audio-daemon (libaudioclient.so)** | already-known gap; PHASE F still hits it | DEFER until M7 noice-e2e — the `UnsatisfiedLinkError` only matters once noice actually plays audio. |

### 13.8 Cross-check: should `bcp-sigbus-repro.sh` mirror the change?

**No.** `bcp-sigbus-repro.sh` is a PF-arch-053 *regression canary* that
verifies the BCP can be loaded without SIGBUS in the *worst case*. The
worst case for SIGBUS coverage is the *largest* BCP, which includes
services.jar. HelloBinder (the test app) doesn't touch Guava, so the
classpath collision that broke noice doesn't trigger for HelloBinder.
Keeping `--bcp-framework` mode inclusive in `bcp-sigbus-repro.sh` is
correct.

The corresponding boot script (`m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh`) has been
re-commented to make this explicit and to point new readers at
`noice-discover.sh` as the stricter (real-app) BCP template.

### 13.9 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE2)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| services.jar removed from `noice-discover.sh` BCP | PASS — line 91 in test script changed (services.jar dropped); on-device script re-pushed and re-run |
| `bcp-sigbus-repro.sh` regression coverage preserved | PASS — `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh --bcp-framework` still includes services.jar (worst-case SIGBUS coverage); only the comment was updated |
| Re-discovery completes without crash | PASS — exit 0 |
| `ImmutableMap.h` `NoSuchMethodError` gone | PASS |
| Application.onCreate() completes without throwing | PASS |
| Application.onCreate() fires zero binder transactions | PASS (observed: no `nativeGetService` lines between the two PHASE E log lines) |
| PHASE F AudioSystem `UnsatisfiedLinkError` still expected | PASS (unchanged; libaudioclient.so M5 gap is well-documented) |

M4-PRE2 is the BCP-correctness gate. The newly-uncovered prerequisite is
M4-PRE3 (MainActivity launch driver), which the orchestrator should
dispatch next in parallel with M4a / M4-power speculative
implementations.

## 14. Post-M4-PRE3 re-discovery (2026-05-12 late night)

After M4-PRE3 extended `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` with PHASE G
(`phaseG_mainActivityLaunch`), the re-discovery surfaced a hard
prerequisite gap *before* Activity.attach can be reached.

### 14.1 What PHASE G drives

Per the M4-PRE3 brief: instantiate noice's MainActivity via
`Instrumentation.newActivity(ClassLoader, String, Intent)`, call
`Activity.attach(...)` reflectively (the 18-arg API-30 signature), then
call `Activity.onCreate(null)`. Each sub-step has its own try/catch and
records its own pass/fail.

```java
// Pseudocode (see aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java
// phaseG_mainActivityLaunch())
G1: Looper.prepareMainLooper()   // best-effort; tolerate failure
G2: Instrumentation.newActivity(noicePCL, "com....noice.activity.MainActivity",
                                Intent + ComponentName)
G3: Activity.attach(westlakeCtx, null aThread, new Instrumentation(),
                    new Binder() token, ident=0, noiceApp, intent,
                    buildActivityInfo(), null title, null parent, null id,
                    null nonConfig, new Configuration(), null referrer,
                    null voice, null window, null configCb, new Binder() assistToken)
G4: MainActivity.onCreate(null)
```

### 14.2 The new failure point (PRE-attach, not attach itself)

PHASE G fails at **G1** (Looper preparation) and consequently at **G2**
(MainActivity instantiation):

```
PHASE G:  Looper.prepareMainLooper FAILED (continuing):
   UnsatisfiedLinkError: No implementation found for long
   android.os.MessageQueue.nativeInit() (tried Java_android_os_MessageQueue_nativeInit
   and Java_android_os_MessageQueue_nativeInit__) - is the library loaded,
   e.g. System.loadLibrary?

DISCOVER-FAIL: PHASE G2: Instrumentation.newActivity(MainActivity) threw
   java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: null
   cause[1]: java.lang.RuntimeException: Can't create handler inside thread
     Thread[main-256mb,0,main] that has not called Looper.prepare()
```

#### 14.2.1 Diagnosis

`Instrumentation.newActivity(ClassLoader, String, Intent)` uses
`AppComponentFactory.DEFAULT.instantiateActivity()` (because
Instrumentation.mThread is null — see logged warning
`"Uninitialized ActivityThread, likely app-created Instrumentation,
 disabling AppComponentFactory"`), which is essentially
`cl.loadClass(className).newInstance()`.

Class load succeeds — `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice.activity.MainActivity`
loads, and its parent chain (`v3.e` → `e.q` → `androidx.fragment.app.d0` →
`androidx.activity.ComponentActivity` → `c0.p` → `android.app.Activity`)
all class-init cleanly.

The `MainActivity.<init>()` body (smali line 52-64 of MainActivity.smali):
```smali
new-instance v0, Landroid/os/Handler;
invoke-static {}, Landroid/os/Looper;->getMainLooper()Landroid/os/Looper;
move-result-object v1
invoke-direct {v0, v1}, Landroid/os/Handler;-><init>(Landroid/os/Looper;)V
```

allocates a `Handler` bound to `Looper.getMainLooper()`. Without
`Looper.prepareMainLooper()` having run, `getMainLooper()` returns null,
and `new Handler(null)` falls back to `Looper.myLooper()` which is also
null on this thread — Handler ctor throws
`"Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare()"`.

#### 14.2.2 Why we can't call Looper.prepare()

`Looper.prepare()` does:
```java
sThreadLocal.set(new Looper(quitAllowed));
// Looper ctor in turn does:
//   mQueue = new MessageQueue(quitAllowed);
// MessageQueue ctor:
//   mPtr = nativeInit();
```

`MessageQueue.nativeInit()` is a JNI method bound to
`android_os_MessageQueue.cpp` in AOSP, normally registered by
`libandroid_runtime.so`. In our sandbox `dalvikvm` has a static
`binder_jni_stub.cc` that registers `android.os.ServiceManager` and
`android.os.Binder` natives — but NOT `android.os.MessageQueue` or
`android.os.Looper` natives. Hence `UnsatisfiedLinkError`.

#### 14.2.3 Scope of the gap

| Class | Native methods | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MessageQueue` | `nativeInit`, `nativeDestroy`, `nativePollOnce`, `nativeWake`, `nativeIsPolling`, `nativeSetFileDescriptorEvents` | 6 methods. `nativeInit` blocks any Looper construction. |
| `Looper` | (none directly; relies on MessageQueue) | Looper.prepare → MessageQueue ctor → nativeInit |
| `Handler` | (none directly; uses Looper + MessageQueue) | Handler ctor allocates Message; uses Looper.mQueue.enqueueMessage |
| `Message` | (none) | pure Java |

The MessageQueue JNI cluster is ~6 functions and an `Looper`-backed event
loop on the C++ side. AOSP's impl uses `epoll` over a pipe; on our sandbox
that maps fine to Linux primitives.

### 14.3 What we did NOT learn (because we can't reach it)

Without `MainActivity.<init>()` succeeding, we cannot call:
- `Activity.attach(...)` — so we cannot observe what binder transactions
  attach itself fires
- `Activity.onCreate(null)` — so we cannot observe Hilt's
  `@Inject`-triggered `Context.getSystemService(...)` calls

The smali analysis (§2) tells us *which* services noice's source code
references — but it does not tell us *which transaction code* on each
service noice's first MainActivity-onCreate path actually invokes. That
data still requires a working MainActivity launch driver.

### 14.4 The M4-PRE4 candidate

**Title: MessageQueue / Looper / Handler JNI native bridge.**

Effort estimate: 1-2 days. Scope:

1. Add `art-latest/stubs/messagequeue_jni_stub.cc` (or extend
   `binder_jni_stub.cc`) with 6 native methods:
   - `nativeInit(): long` — returns a malloc'd `NativeMessageQueue` C++
     struct ptr (contains `Looper` ptr + epoll fd)
   - `nativeDestroy(long)` — frees it
   - `nativePollOnce(long ptr, int timeoutMillis)` — wraps `Looper::pollOnce`
   - `nativeWake(long)` — wraps `Looper::wake`
   - `nativeIsPolling(long)` — boolean state query
   - `nativeSetFileDescriptorEvents(long, int fd, int events)` — wraps
     `Looper::addFd` / `removeFd`
2. Register the natives in `JNI_OnLoad_binder_with_cl` (or a sibling
   `JNI_OnLoad_messagequeue`) so they're available the moment
   dalvikvm loads `framework.jar`.
3. The actual `Looper` C++ class is in `frameworks/native/libs/utils/Looper.cpp`
   — already linked into libutils.so; can be reused or reimplemented in
   ~200 LOC for the sandbox.
4. Re-test PHASE G — expected outcome: MainActivity.<init> succeeds,
   then Activity.attach is the next blocker (likely PhoneWindow ctor's
   `getContentResolver().getUserId()` NPE — see §14.5).

This is a sibling milestone to M4-PRE (Context plumbing) and M4-PRE2
(BCP correctness). It is **not** a Binder service implementation, it is
foundation JNI plumbing.

### 14.5 Likely-next blockers after M4-PRE4 (anticipated, not validated)

Once Looper/MessageQueue exists and MainActivity.<init>() succeeds,
PHASE G3 will call `Activity.attach(...)`. The reading of AOSP-11
`Activity.attach` (frameworks/base/core/java/android/app/Activity.java:7886
in the M4-PRE3 reference checkout) reveals these likely NPEs in order:

1. **`new PhoneWindow(context, null, null)` (line 7897)** — the PhoneWindow
   3-arg ctor calls:
   - `super(context)` → `Window(context)` → `Window.getDefaultFeatures(context)`
     → `context.getResources().getBoolean(internalRes)`.
     ❓ Our `WestlakeContextImpl.getResources()` returns `Resources.getSystem()`
     which is non-null and should have `getBoolean` work for internal resource
     IDs. **Expected to pass.**
   - `mLayoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(context)`. Returns a LayoutInflater
     bound to context.getApplicationContext() — should be OK.
   - `Settings.Global.getInt(context.getContentResolver(),
       DEVELOPMENT_RENDER_SHADOWS_IN_COMPOSITOR, 1)` —
     **WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver() returns null →
     NPE on `resolver.getUserId()`.**
   - `Settings.Global.getInt(context.getContentResolver(),
       DEVELOPMENT_FORCE_RESIZABLE_ACTIVITIES, 0)` — same NPE.
   - `context.getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(PICTURE_IN_PICTURE)` —
     **WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager() returns null → NPE.**

2. **`mWindow.setWindowManager((WindowManager)context.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE), ...)`
    (line 7933)** — `getSystemService("window")` returns null currently.
    The framework's `setWindowManager(null, ...)` first checks for null and
    falls back to `(WindowManager)mContext.getSystemService(WINDOW_SERVICE)` —
    still null. Eventually `IWindowManager` is needed (Tier-1).

3. **`mWindowManager = mWindow.getWindowManager()`** — same null path.

So Activity.attach has at least 4 sub-NPEs to navigate inside PhoneWindow's
ctor alone. The right pattern is to either (a) populate
`WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver()` + `getPackageManager()` with
minimum stubs so Settings.Global.getInt returns the default value, or (b)
implement enough of `IPackageManager` (M4c) to back a real PackageManager.

This is **out of scope for M4-PRE3** (it's M4-PRE5 / M4c / WestlakeContextImpl
extension work).

### 14.6 What M4-PRE3 actually changed

| File | Change | LOC |
|---|---|---|
| `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` | added PHASE G (`phaseG_mainActivityLaunch`, `locateActivityAttach`, `buildAttachArgs`, `buildActivityInfo`) | +~280 LOC |
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java` | UNCHANGED (no new methods needed — failure surfaces before Context is even queried beyond the existing `getResources` path) | 0 |
| `aosp-libbinder-port/M4_PRE_NOTES.md` | unchanged | 0 |
| `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` | this §14 append | +~120 LOC |
| `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` | M4-PRE3 row updated; M4-PRE4 row added | minor |

Note: `WestlakeActivityThreadStub.java` was considered but NOT created.
Per the brief: "Possibly a new minimal `WestlakeActivityThreadStub.java` if
AOSP Activity.attach demands a non-null aThread". Activity.attach's
aThread arg accepts null (we pass null in `buildAttachArgs`) — but we
never reach attach. Premature.

### 14.7 Dispatch recommendation (revised)

The M4_DISCOVERY §13.7 ordering changes again:

| Agent / milestone | Status after M4-PRE3 | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **M4-PRE4 — MessageQueue/Looper/Handler JNI bridge** | NEW prerequisite uncovered | DISPATCH IMMEDIATELY. 1-2 days. Add `messagequeue_jni_stub.cc` (or extend `binder_jni_stub.cc`) with 6 native methods. Re-test PHASE G. |
| **M4-power — `IPowerManager`** | unblocked | DISPATCH IN PARALLEL with M4-PRE4. ~0.5 days. Hilt-DI'd repositories use `WakeLock` during audio playback; high speculative confidence. Verify with binder smoke test. |
| **M4a — `IActivityManager` Tier-1 subset** | unblocked | DISPATCH IN PARALLEL with M4-PRE4. ~2 days. The minimum subset: `getIntentForIntentSender`, `getRunningAppProcesses`, `getCurrentUser` (return 0), `registerProcessObserver` (no-op), `attachApplication` (no-op return). Verify with binder smoke test. |
| **M4-PRE5 — WestlakeContextImpl getContentResolver + getPackageManager stubs** | NEW prerequisite (anticipated) | HOLD until M4-PRE4 lands. After PHASE G3 attempts attach, the next blocker is likely PhoneWindow's Settings.Global.getInt(getContentResolver(), ...) NPE. Estimated 0.5-1 day to add minimum stubs. |
| **M4b — `IWindowManager` + `IWindowSession`** | hold | DEFER. Will be triggered by Activity.attach's `mWindow.setWindowManager(...)` once we reach it. |
| **M4c — `IPackageManager`** | hold | DEFER. Likely needed by Activity.attach + Resources/Theme during onCreate's layout inflation. |
| **M4d — `IDisplayManager`** | hold | DEFER. Likely needed by `Display.getRealMetrics()` during layout. |
| **M4e — `INotificationManager` + `IInputMethodManager`** | hold | DEFER. Needed for noice's MediaSession/foreground service flow. |
| **M5 — westlake-audio-daemon** | unchanged | DEFER until M7. |

### 14.8 Concrete dispatch — what M4a / M4-power should implement (speculative, since not validated by noice yet)

The M4_DISCOVERY §6 lists candidates. Since M4-PRE3 did not validate any
real transaction yet (MainActivity ctor was the blocker), the M4a /
M4-power agents must dispatch based on §6 static analysis + §7 AOSP
canonical first-frame requirements:

#### M4a (IActivityManager Tier-1 subset) — minimum to register:

These are the transactions speculatively most likely to fire during
Activity launch and Hilt @Inject; M4a should register a Stub.onTransact
that LOGI's every received code and implements at least these:

| AOSP method (Android 11) | Likely transaction code* | Min impl | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getCurrentUser()` | TRANSACTION_getCurrentUser ≈ 71 | return UserHandle(USER_SYSTEM=0) | Used by Hilt's DI to scope component lifetime |
| `attachApplication(IApplicationThread, long startSeq)` | TRANSACTION_attachApplication ≈ 1 | no-op return (we're not driving the ActivityThread.handleBindApplication path) | Defensive |
| `getIntentForIntentSender(IIntentSender)` | TRANSACTION_getIntentForIntentSender ≈ 76 | return null | Defensive |
| `registerProcessObserver(IProcessObserver)` | TRANSACTION_registerProcessObserver ≈ 86 | no-op | Often called by AppOpsManager-using code |
| `unregisterReceiver(IIntentReceiver)` | TRANSACTION_unregisterReceiver ≈ 39 | no-op | Symmetric with registerReceiverWithFeature |
| `registerReceiverWithFeature(...)` | TRANSACTION_registerReceiverWithFeature ≈ 38 | return new Intent() (empty sticky) | Often called by services + Hilt's WorkManager |
| `getMyMemoryState(MemoryInfo)` | TRANSACTION_getMyMemoryState ≈ 130 | populate MemoryInfo with safe defaults | Defensive — app may probe |

*Transaction codes are AOSP Android 11 generated-code estimates from
AIDL declaration order — the M4a agent should re-derive these by loading
`android.app.IActivityManager$Stub` class and reading
`TRANSACTION_xxx = (FIRST_CALL_TRANSACTION + N)` fields via Java reflection.
That is authoritative for the framework.jar we ship.

#### M4-power (IPowerManager) — minimum to register:

| AOSP method | Transaction code* | Min impl |
|---|---|---|
| `acquireWakeLock(IBinder lock, int flags, String tag, ...)` | TRANSACTION_acquireWakeLock ≈ 1 | no-op (succeed) |
| `acquireWakeLockWithUid(...)` | TRANSACTION_acquireWakeLockWithUid ≈ 2 | no-op |
| `releaseWakeLock(IBinder lock, int flags)` | TRANSACTION_releaseWakeLock ≈ 3 | no-op |
| `isInteractive()` | TRANSACTION_isInteractive ≈ 8 | return true |
| `userActivity(...)` | TRANSACTION_userActivity ≈ 9 | no-op |
| `goToSleep(...)` | TRANSACTION_goToSleep ≈ 10 | no-op |

Verification: M4a + M4-power agents should each write a binder smoke
test that calls Stub.asInterface(ServiceManager.getService("activity"))
post-registration and exercises 1-2 of these methods, confirming the
in-process Stub.asInterface elision works (same-process Binder, no
ioctl). This was proven in M3 with HelloBinder.dex.

### 14.9 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE3)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| PHASE G added to NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java | PASS |
| PHASE G executes without crashing discovery harness | PASS — discovery exits 0 |
| MainActivity instantiation attempted via Instrumentation.newActivity | PASS — newActivity threw a captured RuntimeException |
| Activity.attach reached | FAIL — blocked by MainActivity.<init>'s Handler allocation |
| Activity.onCreate reached | FAIL — blocked upstream |
| Binder transactions surfaced during PHASE G | 0 (same as PHASE E) — failure is in JNI plumbing, not Binder |
| M4-PRE4 candidate documented | PASS — this §14 |
| Dispatch recommendation for M4a/b/c/d/e | PASS — §14.7 + §14.8 |

M4-PRE3's contribution is **negative evidence**: it proves that
MainActivity launch is not reachable through dalvikvm's current native
bridge surface, identifies the precise missing JNI cluster
(MessageQueue + Looper + Handler), and unblocks M4-PRE4 dispatch.

## 15. M4-power landed (2026-05-12 night)

M4-power dispatched in parallel with M4-PRE3 (per §14.7 recommendation).
Implementation complete and verified via synthetic smoke test.

### 15.1 What was built

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakePowerManagerService.java` (NEW) | ~290 | Extends framework.jar's `android.os.IPowerManager$Stub` (Android 16 / 71 methods). 6 real overrides + 65 safe-default no-ops. Real impls: `isInteractive` (returns true), `isDisplayInteractive` (returns true), `acquireWakeLock` (stores token in synchronized HashMap, no real semantics), `acquireWakeLockWithUid` (same), `releaseWakeLock` (removes token), `getBrightnessConstraint` (returns 0.5), `userActivity` (no-op), `setStayOnSetting` (no-op), `acquireWakeLockAsync` (same as acquireWakeLock), `releaseWakeLockAsync` (same as releaseWakeLock). Other methods inherit no-op defaults via explicit `@Override` (Stub doesn't extend Default, so all 71 abstract methods need bodies). |
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/ServiceRegistrar.java` (NEW) | ~55 | Central place to call `ServiceManager.addService` for every M4 service. `registerAllServices()` is idempotent; safe to call from boot or from tests. Currently registers only `power`; M4a/c/d/e will add their services here. |
| `shim/java/android/os/IPowerManager.java` (NEW, compile-time shim only) | ~250 | Hand-written compile-time stub matching Android 16 IPowerManager.aidl surface (71 methods + Stub abstract class + Default class + 2 nested parcelables). Stripped from `aosp-shim.dex` via `framework_duplicates.txt` so framework.jar's real `IPowerManager$Stub` wins at runtime. Pattern follows the existing `INotificationManager.java` shim. |
| `shim/java/android/os/IWakeLockCallback.java` (NEW, compile-time only) | ~25 | AIDL-callback stub; stripped. |
| `shim/java/android/os/IScreenTimeoutPolicyListener.java` (NEW, compile-time only) | ~25 | AIDL-callback stub; stripped. |
| `shim/java/android/os/PowerSaveState.java` (NEW, compile-time only) | ~15 | Parcelable stub; stripped. |
| `shim/java/android/os/BatterySaverPolicyConfig.java` (NEW, compile-time only) | ~10 | Parcelable stub; stripped. |
| `shim/java/android/os/ParcelDuration.java` (NEW, compile-time only) | ~10 | Parcelable stub; stripped. |
| `scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` (UPDATED) | +6 lines | Added: `android/os/BatterySaverPolicyConfig`, `android/os/IPowerManager`, `android/os/IScreenTimeoutPolicyListener`, `android/os/IWakeLockCallback`, `android/os/ParcelDuration`, `android/os/PowerSaveState`. |
| `aosp-libbinder-port/test/PowerServiceTest.java` (NEW) | ~290 | Synthetic smoke test mirroring `AsInterfaceTest.java`. Constructs WestlakePowerManagerService directly, registers via `ServiceManager.addService("power", binder)`, verifies round-trip with `getService("power")`, verifies `IPowerManager.Stub.asInterface(b)` returns the SAME service (direct Java dispatch active), exercises wake-lock acquire/release cycle, brightness probe, listServices check. Bundles `AsInterfaceTest.class` into the dex to reuse its already-registered `println`/`eprintln` natives (no new natives added). |
| `aosp-libbinder-port/build_power_service_test.sh` (NEW) | ~75 | Build script, modeled on `build_asinterface.sh`. Produces `out/PowerServiceTest.dex` (~14 KB). |

### 15.2 Why all 71 methods get bodies (not just 5+safe defaults from Stub)

Brief originally said "let them inherit defaults from the Stub (which
return 0/null/false)". This turned out to be **incorrect about AIDL**:
AOSP's AIDL-generated `Stub` is `abstract` and does NOT extend `Default`.
The `Default` class is a separate helper that AIDL emits for the
proxy-fallback path (`Stub.Proxy` uses `getDefaultImpl()` when transact
returns false). Concretely:

```java
public interface IPowerManager { /* 71 abstract methods */ }
public static class Default implements IPowerManager { /* 71 empty methods */ }
public static abstract class Stub extends android.os.Binder implements IPowerManager {
    // does NOT extend Default; subclasses MUST implement all 71 methods
    public boolean onTransact(int code, Parcel data, Parcel reply, int flags) { ... }
}
```

So `WestlakePowerManagerService extends Stub` is forced to provide
bodies for all 71 IPowerManager methods or the JVM throws
`AbstractMethodError` at `new WestlakePowerManagerService()` time
(verified empirically — the smoke test failed at construction with
abstract method error during early iteration).

The fix: explicit `@Override` body for every IPowerManager method.
Real-behavior methods get their behavior; the rest return safe defaults
(0/null/false/no-op). Total: 71 method bodies, of which 10 have
meaningful behavior and 61 are trivial 1-line stubs. ~290 LOC.

### 15.3 Smoke test result

`PowerServiceTest.dex` on OnePlus 6, via `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh test
--test PowerServiceTest --bcp-shim --bcp-framework`:

```
PowerServiceTest: constructed com.westlake.services.WestlakePowerManagerService@...
PowerServiceTest: ServiceManager.addService(power) OK
PowerServiceTest: ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices() -> 1 service(s)
PowerServiceTest: getService("power") -> WestlakePowerManagerService{wakelocks=0}
PowerServiceTest: IPowerManager.Stub.asInterface(b) -> WestlakePowerManagerService{wakelocks=0}
PowerServiceTest:   proxy.class = com.westlake.services.WestlakePowerManagerService
PowerServiceTest: asInterface returned SAME service -- direct Java dispatch ACTIVE
PowerServiceTest: isInteractive() -> true
PowerServiceTest: acquireWakeLock OK
PowerServiceTest: activeWakeLockCount after acquire = 1
PowerServiceTest: releaseWakeLock OK
PowerServiceTest: activeWakeLockCount after release = 0
PowerServiceTest: getBrightnessConstraint(0,0) -> 0.5
PowerServiceTest: listServices contains "power" -- OK
PowerServiceTest: PASS
PowerServiceTest: exiting with code 0
```

**Exit code: 0.**

### 15.4 What M4-power validates for downstream M4 milestones

1. **The "extend IXxxService.Stub" pattern works in our sandbox.** Same
   process, no proxy needed. queryLocalInterface returns the same
   service instance, asInterface succeeds with direct Java dispatch.
2. **Hand-stubbed AIDL interfaces compile cleanly and get stripped
   correctly.** `framework_duplicates.txt` machinery is reliable.
3. **ServiceRegistrar is the right wiring point.** M4a should add
   `ServiceManager.addService("activity", new WestlakeActivityManagerService())`
   into the same `registerAllServices()` method.
4. **`Stub doesn't extend Default`** is a fact every M4 milestone must
   plan for — all interface methods need bodies. Budget ~1.5x the
   "real methods needed" count for the extra safe-default no-ops.

### 15.5 Acceptance test status (M4-power)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| `WestlakePowerManagerService` extends `IPowerManager.Stub` | PASS |
| `ServiceManager.addService("power", svc)` succeeds | PASS |
| `getService("power")` returns the registered binder | PASS |
| `IPowerManager.Stub.asInterface(b)` returns IPowerManager (not Proxy) | PASS |
| asInterface returns SAME service object (queryLocalInterface elision) | PASS |
| `isInteractive()` returns true | PASS |
| `acquireWakeLock` + `releaseWakeLock` round trip; activeWakeLockCount 0->1->0 | PASS |
| `getBrightnessConstraint` returns reasonable float (0.5) | PASS |
| `listServices` contains "power" | PASS |
| Test exits with code 0 | PASS |

M4-power complete. Downstream M4a-e milestones may now proceed using
the same pattern.

## 16. Post-M4-PRE4 re-discovery (2026-05-12 late night)

After M4-PRE4 statically linked the 6 `android.os.MessageQueue` native
methods into dalvikvm, the re-discovery cleared the `Looper.prepareMainLooper`
blocker that ended §14 and the harness PROGRESSED PAST MainActivity.<init>()
all the way through 17 of 20 `Activity.attach()` arguments before NPEing
on a different missing dependency. This is the outcome §14.4 predicted.

### 16.1 What M4-PRE4 changed

| File | Change | LOC |
|---|---|---|
| `art-latest/stubs/messagequeue_jni_stub.cc` | NEW. JNI glue mirroring AOSP's `android_os_MessageQueue.cpp`; thin wrapper over `android::Looper` (already in libutils via `libbinder_full_static.a`). Implements `nativeInit`/`nativeDestroy`/`nativePollOnce`/`nativeWake`/`nativeIsPolling`/`nativeSetFileDescriptorEvents`. Includes `NativeMessageQueue` class that delivers epoll fd events back to Java via cached `MessageQueue.dispatchEvents(II)I` mid. | +296 |
| `art-latest/stubs/binder_jni_stub.cc` | Chained `JNI_OnLoad_messagequeue_with_cl(vm, classLoader)` call at the end of `JNI_OnLoad_binder_with_cl` so MessageQueue natives register the moment ServiceManager.<clinit>'s `System.loadLibrary("android_runtime_stub")` short-circuit fires. | +9 |
| `art-latest/Makefile.bionic-arm64` | Compile rule for `messagequeue_jni_stub.cc` + linker entry under `link-runtime`. Reuses libutils_binder include set (Looper.h, Vector.h, RefBase.h). | +15 |
| `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` | M4-PRE4 row flipped to `done`; M4-PRE5 promoted to top priority. | minor |
| `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` | this §16 append | +~120 |

No Looper.cpp port was required: libutils' `Looper.o` was already
present in `libbinder_full_static.a` because libbinder depends on
libutils. `nm libbinder_full_static.a | grep _ZN7android6Looper`
confirmed all needed symbols (`Looper::pollOnce`, `wake`, `addFd`,
`removeFd`, `setForThread`, `getForThread`, `isPolling`, ctor/dtor).
Pure additive change.

### 16.2 New phase outcomes (2026-05-12 11:41 phone-local)

```
PHASE A: 0/70 services resolved        (unchanged)
PHASE B: 5/7 classes loadable          (unchanged)
PHASE C: PASSED                        (unchanged)
PHASE D: PASSED                        (unchanged)
PHASE E: PASSED unexpectedly           (unchanged)
PHASE F: 5 Singletons, 1 failed        (unchanged — AudioSystem)
PHASE G1: PASSED — Looper.prepareMainLooper now works  *** NEW ***
PHASE G2: PASSED — MainActivity instantiated           *** NEW ***
PHASE G3: FAILED — Activity.attach NPE inside noice    *** NEW ***
          superclass attachBaseContext chain
PHASE G4: not reached
```

Discovery exit code: 0.

### 16.3 JNI registration confirmation (from full log)

```
WLK-mq-jni: JNI_OnLoad_messagequeue: vm=0x701945a000 classLoader=0x70023e187c
WLK-mq-jni: JNI_OnLoad_messagequeue: cached MessageQueue.dispatchEvents mid=0x6ff13cd760
WLK-mq-jni: JNI_OnLoad_messagequeue: android.os.MessageQueue natives: 6/6
```

All 6 methods registered successfully; `dispatchEvents` method id cached
for fd-event delivery (currently unexercised — no app-side fd listeners
yet). MessageQueue.<init>'s `nativeInit` call now reaches our native
code:

```
WLK-mq-jni: nativeInit -> NativeMessageQueue=0x701940fb00 looper=0x701941a280 tid=481073974448
PHASE G:  Looper.prepareMainLooper() -> getMainLooper now: Looper (main-256mb, tid 2) {bb7177}
```

One `nativeInit` allocation (the main thread's Looper). No `nativePollOnce`
calls observed yet (no Looper.loop() running in the discovery harness —
which is fine; the goal was just to make ctor non-null).

### 16.4 The new failure point (PHASE G3 inside Activity.attach)

```
[NPE] android.content.pm.ServiceInfo
      android.content.pm.PackageManager.getServiceInfo(
              android.content.ComponentName, int)
[NPE]   #0 boolean e.v.c(android.content.Context) (dex_pc=32)
[NPE]   #1 void e.q.attachBaseContext(android.content.Context) (dex_pc=22)
[NPE]   #2 void android.app.Activity.attach(android.content.Context,
            android.app.ActivityThread, android.app.Instrumentation,
            android.os.IBinder, int, android.app.Application,
            android.content.Intent, android.content.pm.ActivityInfo,
            java.lang.CharSequence, android.app.Activity,
            java.lang.String, ...) (dex_pc=17)
DISCOVER-FAIL: PHASE G3: Activity.attach threw
  java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: null
  cause[1]: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke
    InvokeType(2) method
    'android.content.pm.ServiceInfo
       android.content.pm.PackageManager.getServiceInfo(
           android.content.ComponentName, int)'
    on a null object reference
```

Interpretation: noice's `ComponentActivity` ancestor (`e.q` after R8
obfuscation) overrides `attachBaseContext` and calls a helper
`e.v.c(Context)` that ultimately invokes
`context.getPackageManager().getServiceInfo(ourComponent, 0)`. Our
`WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager()` returns null (per M4-PRE's
"Defer" table — see §5 / M4_PRE_NOTES §2.5). The lookup is for the
MainActivity's own ServiceInfo, probably to inspect its theme /
metadata.

This is the predicted M4-PRE5 blocker. The full Activity.attach
signature (20 args, Android 16) was successfully reflected and 17/20
arguments were prepared correctly before the call (`WestlakeContextImpl`,
null aThread, fresh Instrumentation, four `new Binder()`s, the noice
Application instance, the Intent + ComponentName, a built ActivityInfo,
a blank Configuration — only voice / window / configCb were null and
Activity.attach tolerates those).

### 16.5 What we did NOT learn (still gated)

Without `attachBaseContext` returning, we still cannot reach:
- `Activity.attach`'s downstream `new PhoneWindow(...)` ctor (which §14.5
  predicted would NPE on `Settings.Global.getInt(context.getContentResolver(),
  ...)`). The PackageManager call is even earlier in the call chain than
  PhoneWindow.
- `Activity.onCreate(null)` — Hilt's @Inject chains
- Binder transaction surface for any Tier-1 service beyond binder=0 in
  Application.onCreate

### 16.6 The M4-PRE5 candidate (now validated, no longer speculative)

**Title: WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager() returns a stub PackageManager
that can resolve the host app's components.**

Scope:
1. Create `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakePackageManagerStub.java`
   extending `android.content.pm.PackageManager` (abstract; ~250 abstract
   methods on Android 16 — most return null/empty/throw).
2. Implement `getServiceInfo(ComponentName, int)` to return a non-null
   `ServiceInfo` whose `packageName` and `name` match the requested
   component. Also `getActivityInfo`, `getApplicationInfo`,
   `resolveActivity`, `queryIntentServices`, `getPackageInfo` —
   noice likely calls several of these during attach.
3. Wire it into `WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager()` to return
   the stub instance.
4. Re-test PHASE G. Expected next failure: PhoneWindow ctor's
   `getContentResolver()` NPE (§14.5 prediction).

Effort estimate: 0.5-1 day.

Alternative path: rather than a bespoke PackageManager subclass, expose
ApplicationPackageManager via reflection wrapping a `WestlakePackageManagerService`
(M4c). But M4c is heavier (binder-backed; needs full `IPackageManager.Stub`
implementation, like M4-power did for IPowerManager). Recommendation:
ship the local stub first to unblock discovery (M4-PRE5), then upgrade
to M4c binder when feature parity demands it.

### 16.7 What's working in dalvikvm now (M4-PRE4 verified)

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| `System.loadLibrary("android_runtime_stub")` → both Binder + MessageQueue natives wire up | OK (single dlopen, single classpath) |
| `Looper.prepareMainLooper()` | OK — creates `android::Looper`, sets thread-local |
| `Looper.getMainLooper()` returns non-null | OK |
| `new MessageQueue(quitAllowed)` → `nativeInit()` → native heap alloc | OK |
| `new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())` does NOT throw | OK |
| `Instrumentation.newActivity(ClassLoader, String, Intent)` for noice MainActivity | OK |
| MainActivity's class-init chain (5 ancestors) | OK |
| Reflective lookup of `Activity.attach` (20-arg signature) | OK |
| `Activity.attach` reaches noice's `attachBaseContext` override | OK |
| Activity.onCreate reachable | not yet (blocked by M4-PRE5) |
| `nativePollOnce` exercised | not yet (no Looper.loop() running) |
| `nativeWake` exercised | not yet |
| fd-event delivery via `dispatchEvents` | not yet |

The unexercised methods (`nativePollOnce` / `nativeWake` / `nativeIsPolling`
/ `nativeSetFileDescriptorEvents`) are wired and ready; they're just not
hit because the harness doesn't run an event loop. They'll be exercised
the first time the app driver calls `Looper.loop()` or `Handler.post()`
inside a runnable that needs to wait on something.

### 16.8 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE4)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| 6 MessageQueue native methods compiled into dalvikvm | PASS |
| Auto-registered on first `loadLibrary("android_runtime_stub")` | PASS — chain from `JNI_OnLoad_binder_with_cl` |
| `nm dalvikvm \| grep Java_android_os_MessageQueue` shows 6 symbols | PASS |
| Discovery harness exits 0 | PASS |
| `Looper.prepareMainLooper()` no longer throws | PASS |
| `getMainLooper()` returns non-null | PASS |
| `Instrumentation.newActivity(MainActivity)` succeeds | PASS |
| Discovery progresses past M4-PRE3's blocking point | PASS — now blocked at PackageManager.getServiceInfo() instead |
| No regression to M3 HelloBinder / M3++ AsInterfaceTest | NOT directly retested (not in dispatch scope); the binder JNI surface is unchanged, only a new chained call was added at the end of JNI_OnLoad_binder; the existing 7+8+2 method registrations still report 7/7, 8/8, 2/2 in the discovery log |
| dalvikvm size delta | +1 MB (27 MB → 28 MB) — within budget |

### 16.9 Dispatch recommendation (revised post-M4-PRE4)

| Agent / milestone | Status after M4-PRE4 | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **M4-PRE5 — WestlakePackageManagerStub** | UNBLOCKED. validation: PHASE G3 reproduces predicted NPE | DISPATCH NEXT. 0.5-1 day. Bespoke local PackageManager stub. Re-test PHASE G3+G4. |
| **M4a — IActivityManager** | unblocked but lower urgency | hold for M4-PRE5; the binder transaction surface is still 0 |
| **M4-power — IPowerManager** | done | no action |
| **M4b — IWindowManager** | hold | likely needed after M4-PRE5 unblocks PhoneWindow ctor's `setWindowManager(...)` |
| **M4c — IPackageManager (binder version)** | hold | upgrade path from M4-PRE5's local stub; defer until noice exercises an out-of-process query |
| **M4d — IDisplayManager** | hold | |
| **M4e — INotificationManager / IInputMethodManager** | hold | |
| **M5 — westlake-audio-daemon** | hold | M7 |

### 16.10 Person-time and risk

- Person-time spent on M4-PRE4: ~3 hours (mostly discovery of where the
  Java MessageQueue class actually came from — it's in
  framework.jar's classes3.dex, not classes.dex; shim's
  `framework_duplicates.txt` strips the shim's MessageQueue/Looper/Handler
  but the older deployed `aosp-shim.dex` still has them; framework.jar
  is on BCP AFTER aosp-shim.dex so the framework version effectively
  wins under ART's class linker tie-breaking once `mPtr` field access
  forces resolution).
- Risk to M3/M3++ tests: low. The chained `JNI_OnLoad_messagequeue_with_cl`
  call is at the very end of `JNI_OnLoad_binder_with_cl` and silently no-ops
  if `android/os/MessageQueue` is not on the classpath (the function
  early-returns with `JNI_VERSION_1_6` after logging). It does not modify
  any state used by ServiceManager / Binder / HelloBinder / AsInterfaceTest.
- Budget consumed: well under the 6-12h estimate from the brief. No Looper.cpp
  port required because libutils symbols are already linked.

### 16.11 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE5 (WestlakePackageManagerStub) should be dispatched immediately**
as the next prerequisite, before M4 service fan-out. The exact NPE
(PackageManager.getServiceInfo(ComponentName,int) returning null)
mirrors the M4-PRE pattern: a Context-level dependency that is local
(not binder-backed) yet blocks any further app code from running. With
M4-PRE5 in place, PHASE G3's `Activity.attach` should reach
PhoneWindow's ctor and stress
`Settings.Global.getInt(context.getContentResolver(), ...)` next —
which is *also* a local Context dependency (M4-PRE6 candidate, much
smaller scope: just return null from getContentResolver and let
Settings.Global swallow the resulting NPE, or stub a no-op resolver).
ONLY after PHASE G4 (Activity.onCreate) is reachable will the M4a
binder-service work begin to surface real transactions. Until then,
M4a / M4b / M4c (binder-backed services) remain speculative and would
be implementing handlers nobody calls.

## 17. M4a — `IActivityManager` Tier-1 service stub (2026-05-12)

[Renumbered by DOC1 from §15 — was a duplicate with the earlier M4-power
section. Section ordering preserved; subsection numbers below similarly
shifted from 15.x to 17.x; content otherwise unchanged.]

**Status:** **COMPLETE (synthetic verification).**  Implementation
landed at `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeActivityManagerService.java`
(~543 LOC; current line count post-CR1/CR2 fail-loud conversion: 672 LOC).
Companion compile-time stubs for the @hide AIDL surface
under `shim/java/android/app/` (IActivityManager + 12 callback
interfaces) and `shim/java/android/content/` (IIntentReceiver,
IIntentSender) and a few @hide payload classes (ParceledListSlice,
ContentProviderHolder, ProfilerInfo, UserInfo, RemoteCallback,
PermissionEnforcer, ApplicationErrorReport.ParcelableCrashInfo,
StrictMode.ViolationInfo, ActivityTaskManager.RootTaskInfo,
ActivityManager.PendingIntentInfo).

### 17.1 What's implemented

- **Tier-1 (real impls; 16 methods):**
  - `getCurrentUserId()` → `0` (USER_SYSTEM, single-user sandbox)
  - `getRunningAppProcesses()` → single-element list with our process info
    (reflection-built `ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo`)
  - `registerProcessObserver(IProcessObserver)` /
    `unregisterProcessObserver(IProcessObserver)` — track in a `HashSet`,
    no dispatch
  - `getIntentForIntentSender(IIntentSender)` → `null`
  - `getTasks(int)` → empty `List`
  - `getProcessMemoryInfo(int[])` → per-pid zero-filled `Debug.MemoryInfo[]`
  - `startActivity(...)` / `startActivityWithFeature(...)` → `-1`
    (START_BAD_VALUE)
  - `attachApplication(IApplicationThread, long)` → no-op
    (M4-PRE3 drives bindApplication directly on ApplicationThread,
    bypassing the system_server callback path)
  - `bindService(...)` / `bindServiceInstance(...)` → `0`
  - `unbindService(IServiceConnection)` → `true`
  - `broadcastIntentWithFeature(...)` → `0` (BROADCAST_SUCCESS)
  - `registerReceiverWithFeature(...)` → `null` (no sticky broadcast)
  - `unregisterReceiver(IIntentReceiver)` → no-op

- **Safe-default no-ops (251 methods):** every remaining abstract method
  in framework.jar's Android 16 IActivityManager interface (267 total)
  is implemented with a `return 0/null/false/empty` body so the JVM
  accepts `new WestlakeActivityManagerService()` as concrete.  Signatures
  match framework.jar exactly so the JVM dispatch table is satisfied.

### 17.2 Constructor pattern

`IActivityManager.Stub`'s deprecated no-arg constructor calls
`ActivityThread.currentActivityThread().getSystemContext()` → NPE in our
sandbox.  We bypass it by calling the alternate `Stub(PermissionEnforcer)`
constructor with a private `NoopPermissionEnforcer extends
PermissionEnforcer` whose protected no-arg ctor sets `mContext=null` and
returns.  No `ActivityThread` lookup; no `getSystemContext` invocation.

### 17.3 Verification

Synthetic smoke test at `aosp-libbinder-port/test/ActivityServiceTest.java`
(built by `aosp-libbinder-port/build_activity_service_test.sh`).  Run via
`m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh --test ActivityServiceTest --bcp-shim
--bcp-framework-strict` (new `--bcp-framework-strict` flag adds
framework.jar + ext.jar to BCP without services.jar — avoids the same
Guava collision noice triggered in M4-PRE2).

```
ActivityServiceTest: starting M4a IActivityManager smoke test
ActivityServiceTest: created WestlakeActivityManagerService: com.westlake.services.WestlakeActivityManagerService@4e217a0
ActivityServiceTest: self queryLocalInterface("android.app.IActivityManager") -> SAME svc object -- OK
ActivityServiceTest: addService("activity", svc) OK
ActivityServiceTest: getService("activity") -> com.westlake.services.WestlakeActivityManagerService@4e217a0
ActivityServiceTest: getService returned SAME svc object -- same-process optimization ACTIVE
ActivityServiceTest: Stub.asInterface returned SAME svc -- direct Java dispatch ACTIVE
ActivityServiceTest: getCurrentUserId() -> 0 -- OK
ActivityServiceTest: getRunningAppProcesses() -> list size=1 -- OK
ActivityServiceTest: getTasks(10) -> list size=0 -- OK
ActivityServiceTest: register/unregisterProcessObserver -- OK
ActivityServiceTest: getIntentForIntentSender(null) -> null -- OK
ActivityServiceTest: getProcessMemoryInfo([pid]) -> array length=1 -- OK
ActivityServiceTest: listServices() contains activity -- OK
ActivityServiceTest: PASS (all Tier-1 verifications)
```

Same-process Stub.asInterface elision (M3++ optimization) ACTIVE:
`fromSM` and `svc` are the same Java object, so method dispatch is a
direct Java vtable call — no Parcel marshaling, no `onTransact`, no
kernel hop.

### 17.4 Ready for M4-PRE3 integration

The service is built into `aosp-shim.dex` and ready to be registered at
sandbox boot.  Next agent (M4-PRE3 or noice driver) should add a single
line near the top of the test wrapper:

```java
android.os.ServiceManager.addService("activity",
        new com.westlake.services.WestlakeActivityManagerService());
```

…and any framework code that does
`IActivityManager.Stub.asInterface(ServiceManager.getService("activity"))`
will resolve to this service.

### 17.5 Companion type stubs added under shim/

```
shim/java/android/app/IActivityManager.java                  (compile-time stub)
shim/java/android/app/IActivityController.java               (binder iface)
shim/java/android/app/IApplicationStartInfoCompleteListener.java
shim/java/android/app/IApplicationThread.java
shim/java/android/app/IForegroundServiceObserver.java
shim/java/android/app/IInstrumentationWatcher.java
shim/java/android/app/IProcessObserver.java
shim/java/android/app/IServiceConnection.java
shim/java/android/app/IStopUserCallback.java
shim/java/android/app/ITaskStackListener.java
shim/java/android/app/IUiAutomationConnection.java
shim/java/android/app/IUidFrozenStateChangedCallback.java
shim/java/android/app/IUidObserver.java
shim/java/android/app/IUserSwitchObserver.java
shim/java/android/app/ActivityTaskManager.java               (with RootTaskInfo inner)
shim/java/android/app/ContentProviderHolder.java
shim/java/android/app/ProfilerInfo.java
shim/java/android/content/IIntentReceiver.java
shim/java/android/content/IIntentSender.java
shim/java/android/content/pm/IPackageDataObserver.java
shim/java/android/content/pm/ParceledListSlice.java
shim/java/android/content/pm/UserInfo.java
shim/java/android/os/IProgressListener.java
shim/java/android/os/PermissionEnforcer.java
shim/java/android/os/RemoteCallback.java
shim/java/com/android/internal/os/IResultReceiver.java
```

All 25 are in `scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` so they're stripped from
`aosp-shim.dex` at packaging time; framework.jar's real classes win at
runtime.

`ActivityManager.PendingIntentInfo` was added as an inner class to the
existing `shim/java/android/app/ActivityManager.java` (already in the
duplicates list).  `ApplicationErrorReport.ParcelableCrashInfo` and
`StrictMode.ViolationInfo` were added as inner classes to their existing
shim parents.

### 17.6 No conflict with M4-power

M4-power's `WestlakePowerManagerService` is in the same package
(`com.westlake.services`) but operates on a disjoint name
(`ServiceManager.addService("power", …)`); the two services co-exist
cleanly in the same `aosp-shim.dex`.  Build verified together.

## 18. Post-M4-PRE5 re-discovery (2026-05-12 late night)

After M4-PRE5 implemented `WestlakePackageManagerStub` and wired it into
`WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager()`, the re-discovery cleared the
PackageManager.getServiceInfo NPE that ended §16 and the harness PROGRESSED
INSIDE the same `e.q.attachBaseContext` method from dex_pc=22 (right at
the start of the helper chain) to dex_pc=193 (well into the method body,
past the entire Hilt @AndroidEntryPoint component-verification sequence).

### 18.1 What M4-PRE5 changed

| File | Change | LOC |
|---|---|---|
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakePackageManagerStub.java` | NEW. Extends `android.content.pm.PackageManager`. Implements all 179 abstract methods on the Android 11 SDK 30 framework.jar surface. 11 methods (`getServiceInfo`, `getActivityInfo`, `getApplicationInfo`, `getPackageInfo`, `hasSystemFeature(String)`, `hasSystemFeature(String,int)`, `resolveActivity`, `resolveService`, `queryIntentActivities`, `getInstalledPackages`, `checkPermission`) have real behavior; 168 are safe-default no-ops. Lazy-parses APK manifest via `ManifestParser.parse()` to identify the host package's components; falls back to synthetic component info for any name matching the host package. | +556 |
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java` | Edit: `getPackageManager()` now returns a lazily-constructed `WestlakePackageManagerStub` singleton (was returning null). | +29 |
| `shim/java/android/content/pm/ComponentInfo.java` | Edit: aligned shim field types with framework.jar's runtime types — `applicationInfo: int -> ApplicationInfo`, `directBootAware: int -> boolean`, `enabled: int -> boolean`, `processName: int -> String`, `splitName: int -> String`. Required because framework.jar's `ComponentInfo` (which wins at runtime via `framework_duplicates.txt`) has `enabled: Z` not `enabled: I`, so the shim's bytecode-emitted `iput-int` to `enabled` failed link-time verification (`NoSuchFieldError: No instance field enabled of type I`). | +/-5 |
| `shim/java/android/content/pm/PackageManager.java` | Added nested stub classes: `OnPermissionsChangedListener` (interface), `MoveCallback` (abstract class), `DexModuleRegisterCallback` (abstract class). Used in PackageManager abstract method signatures (`addOnPermissionsChangeListener`, `registerMoveCallback`, `registerDexModule`). Fixed `enabled = 1` -> `enabled = true` in three internal builders post-type alignment. | +18 |
| `shim/java/android/content/pm/IPackageDeleteObserver.java` | NEW compile-time stub. Stripped at DEX time so framework.jar wins. | +21 |
| `shim/java/android/content/pm/IPackageStatsObserver.java` | NEW compile-time stub. Same pattern. | +21 |
| `shim/java/android/content/pm/KeySet.java` | NEW compile-time stub (used by `getKeySetByAlias` / `getSigningKeySet` / `isSignedBy` abstract methods). | +13 |
| `shim/java/android/content/pm/VerifierDeviceIdentity.java` | NEW compile-time stub (used by `getVerifierDeviceIdentity`). | +9 |
| `shim/java/android/os/storage/VolumeInfo.java` | NEW compile-time stub (used by `getPackageCandidateVolumes`, `getPackageCurrentVolume`, `movePackage`, etc.). | +15 |
| `shim/java/android/app/HostBridge.java` | Edit: `dst.enabled = getBooleanField(src, "enabled") ? 1 : 0;` -> `dst.enabled = getBooleanField(src, "enabled");` post-ComponentInfo.enabled type fix. | +/-1 |
| `scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` | Added 5 new entries so framework.jar wins for our shim stubs at runtime: `android/content/pm/IPackageDeleteObserver`, `android/content/pm/IPackageStatsObserver`, `android/content/pm/KeySet`, `android/content/pm/VerifierDeviceIdentity`, `android/os/storage/VolumeInfo`. | +5 |
| `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` | this §18 append (was §17 pre-DOC1 renumber) | +~120 |

Total new shim source: ~700 LOC. aosp-shim.dex grew from 1.41 MB to 1.48 MB (+45 KB).

### 18.2 New phase outcomes (2026-05-12 12:01 phone-local)

```
PHASE A: 2/70 services resolved        ("activity", "power" — unchanged)
PHASE B: 5/7 classes loadable          (unchanged)
PHASE C: PASSED                        (unchanged)
PHASE D: PASSED                        (unchanged)
PHASE E: PASSED unexpectedly           (unchanged)
PHASE F: 5 Singletons, 1 failed        (unchanged — AudioSystem)
PHASE G1: PASSED — Looper.prepareMainLooper now works
PHASE G2: PASSED — MainActivity instantiated
PHASE G3: FAILED at *new* dex_pc=193     *** PROGRESS ***
          inside e.q.attachBaseContext  (was dex_pc=22)
PHASE G4: not reached
```

Discovery exit code: 0.

### 18.3 The new failure point (PHASE G3 inside Activity.attach, much deeper now)

```
[NPE] android.content.res.Configuration
      android.content.res.Resources.getConfiguration()
[NPE]   #0 void e.q.attachBaseContext(android.content.Context) (dex_pc=193)
[NPE]   #1 void android.app.Activity.attach(android.content.Context,
            android.app.ActivityThread, android.app.Instrumentation,
            android.os.IBinder, int, android.app.Application,
            android.content.Intent, android.content.pm.ActivityInfo,
            java.lang.CharSequence, android.app.Activity,
            java.lang.String, ..., android.os.IBinder)  (dex_pc=17)
DISCOVER-FAIL: PHASE G3: Activity.attach threw
  java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: null
  cause[1]: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke
    InvokeType(2) method
    'android.content.res.Configuration
       android.content.res.Resources.getConfiguration()'
    on a null object reference
```

Interpretation: noice's `e.q.attachBaseContext` (Hilt-DI parent class
after R8 obfuscation) progressed past the entire @AndroidEntryPoint
verification path (PackageManager.getServiceInfo, getActivityInfo,
getApplicationInfo etc.) and is now well into AppCompat/AndroidX boot
that calls `context.getResources().getConfiguration()` to determine
locale / DPI / night-mode settings. `WestlakeContextImpl.getResources()`
returns null because `Resources.getSystem()` itself fails to initialize:

```
Tolerating clinit failure for Landroid/content/res/ResourcesImpl;:
  java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: No implementation found for long
  android.content.res.AssetManager.nativeGetThemeFreeFunction()
```

`ResourcesImpl.<clinit>` calls `AssetManager.nativeGetThemeFreeFunction()`
as a class-init constant. That native lives in `libandroid_runtime.so`
(specifically `android_content_res_AssetManager.cpp`), which we don't
have. ART's class-linker tolerates the clinit failure (so AOSP code that
defensively wraps Resources access in try/catch can keep running), but
`Resources.getSystem()` returns null when ResourcesImpl is half-initialized.

This is the predicted M4-PRE6 candidate (Resources/AssetManager native
bridge), though M4-PRE5's brief noted §14.5's prediction was
"PhoneWindow ctor's getContentResolver NPE" — that came later in the
chain than this Resources init. The discovery is doing its job:
revealing the actual next blocker.

### 18.4 What's confirmed working in dalvikvm now (M4-PRE5 verified)

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| `WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager()` returns non-null | OK |
| `PackageManager.getServiceInfo(ComponentName, int)` returns populated info | OK |
| `PackageManager.getActivityInfo(ComponentName, int)` returns populated info | OK |
| `PackageManager.getApplicationInfo(String, int)` returns our cached info | OK |
| `PackageManager.getPackageInfo(String, int)` returns populated info | OK |
| `PackageManager.hasSystemFeature(*)` returns false safely | OK |
| Hilt's `@AndroidEntryPoint` component verification path | OK |
| AndroidX AppLocalesMetadataHolderService lookup tolerates synthetic ServiceInfo | OK |
| `e.q.attachBaseContext(Context)` execution advances ~10x further (22 → 193 dex_pc) | OK |
| Activity.attach reaches mid-AppCompat boot | OK |
| Resources.getSystem() returns non-null | not yet (blocked by M4-PRE6: AssetManager natives) |
| getResources().getConfiguration() returns non-null | not yet (blocked by M4-PRE6) |
| Activity.onCreate reachable | not yet (blocked by M4-PRE6) |

### 18.5 What we did NOT learn (still gated)

Without `attachBaseContext` returning, we still cannot reach:
- `Activity.attach`'s downstream `new PhoneWindow(...)` ctor (which was
  §16.5's predicted next blocker — pushed out one step by this finding).
- `Activity.onCreate(null)` — Hilt's @Inject chains
- Binder transaction surface for any Tier-1 service beyond binder=0 in
  Application.onCreate

### 18.6 The M4-PRE6 candidate (now validated, no longer speculative)

**Title: WestlakeContextImpl.getResources() returns a Resources instance
whose getConfiguration() / getDisplayMetrics() / getString() / etc.
don't NPE.**

Scope:
1. Either:
   (a) port the minimal `libandroid_runtime`-style AssetManager native
       cluster to dalvikvm (the same pattern as M4-PRE4's
       MessageQueue/Looper JNI bridge — see §15.1) so
       `Resources.getSystem()` can complete; OR
   (b) wrap a synthetic Resources subclass whose getConfiguration()
       returns `new Configuration()` and whose getDisplayMetrics() /
       getString() / etc. all return safe defaults — bypassing
       AssetManager entirely. Less ambitious; matches the M4-PRE5
       PackageManager pattern.
2. Wire it into `WestlakeContextImpl.getResources()` to return the
   synthetic instance.
3. Re-test PHASE G3. Expected next failure: PhoneWindow ctor or
   ContentResolver/Settings lookups (§16.5's prediction, deferred one
   step).

Effort estimate: 0.5-2 days depending on path (a vs b). Path (b) is
much lighter; reach for path (a) only if discovery says synthetic
Resources isn't enough.

### 18.7 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE5)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| WestlakePackageManagerStub builds cleanly with all 179 abstract methods | PASS |
| Shim PackageManager + ComponentInfo + 5 new stub classes + duplicates updates compile and pack into aosp-shim.dex | PASS |
| aosp-shim.dex size delta | +45 KB (1.41 → 1.48 MB) — well within budget |
| `new WestlakePackageManagerStub(...)` succeeds at runtime (no `InstantiationError`) | PASS — observed instantiating from WestlakeContextImpl |
| Discovery harness exits 0 | PASS |
| PHASE G3 progresses past M4-PRE4's blocking point (`getServiceInfo` NPE) | PASS — now blocked at `getResources().getConfiguration()` instead, 171 dex_pc deeper into attachBaseContext |
| No regression to M3 HelloBinder / M4-power tests | NOT directly retested (M4-PRE5 only added classes; existing binder JNI surface unchanged); the new shim is loaded only via `WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager()` lazy initialization, which the M3 / M4-power tests don't exercise |

### 18.8 Dispatch recommendation (revised post-M4-PRE5)

| Agent / milestone | Status after M4-PRE5 | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **M4-PRE6 — Resources/AssetManager stub (or native bridge)** | UNBLOCKED. validation: PHASE G3 reproduces predicted NPE | DISPATCH NEXT. 0.5-2 days. Either synthetic Resources subclass (lighter path) or native AssetManager JNI bridge (heavier path). Re-test PHASE G3+G4. |
| **M4a — IActivityManager** | unblocked + observable | registered service is reached via PHASE A; but only one synthetic test transaction was driven (no real Activity.attach-time call yet). Hold for M4-PRE6 to see real transactions surface. |
| **M4-power — IPowerManager** | done + observable | registered service is reached via PHASE A. No real transactions yet from noice. |
| **M4b — IWindowManager** | hold | likely needed after M4-PRE6 unblocks PhoneWindow ctor's `setWindowManager(...)` |
| **M4c — IPackageManager (binder version)** | hold | upgrade path from M4-PRE5's local stub; defer until noice exercises an out-of-process query |
| **M4d — IDisplayManager** | hold | |
| **M4e — INotificationManager / IInputMethodManager** | hold | |
| **M5 — westlake-audio-daemon** | hold | M7 |

### 18.9 Person-time and risk

- Person-time spent on M4-PRE5: ~3 hours (mostly type-alignment of
  shim `ComponentInfo.enabled: int -> boolean` once the runtime
  `NoSuchFieldError` surfaced; the 179-method stub generation itself
  was Python-script-driven from a `dexdump` of framework.jar's
  PackageManager abstract method list — same pattern as M4a's
  IActivityManager 254-method generation).
- Risk to M3/M3++ / M4-power tests: very low. WestlakePackageManagerStub
  is loaded only when `WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager()` is
  called, which neither HelloBinder nor PowerServiceTest exercises.
  The shim's `ComponentInfo` field-type changes (`enabled: int -> boolean`)
  could affect existing code that does `info.enabled = 1`, but a
  grep audit found only three such sites (all internal shim builders
  in `PackageManager.java` and one place in `HostBridge.java`),
  fixed in this milestone.
- Budget consumed: well within the 4-6h estimate from the brief.

### 18.10 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE6 (WestlakeContextImpl.getResources stub) should be dispatched
immediately** as the next prerequisite, before M4 service fan-out. The
exact NPE (`Resources.getConfiguration()` returning null because
`Resources.getSystem()` is null because `ResourcesImpl.<clinit>` failed
on `AssetManager.nativeGetThemeFreeFunction`) follows the same pattern
as M4-PRE5: a local (not binder-backed) Context dependency blocking
any further app code. The cheapest path is a synthetic Resources
subclass overriding ~5-10 methods (getConfiguration, getDisplayMetrics,
getString, getDimensionPixelSize, getColor); the heavier path is a
mini-AssetManager native bridge. M4-PRE6 unblocks `attachBaseContext`
which unblocks `Activity.attach` completion which unblocks PHASE G4
(MainActivity.onCreate) which is where Hilt's @Inject chains finally
issue real Binder transactions — at which point the M4a-e binder
service work begins to surface real callers and the discovery loop
exits the local-Context plumbing phase.

## 19. CR2 — fail-loud unobserved service methods (2026-05-12)

Per codex Tier 2 review (`/tmp/codex-review-output.txt` §2 #1 HIGH for
WestlakeActivityManagerService, #2 MEDIUM for WestlakePowerManagerService)
and AGENT_SWARM_PLAYBOOK.md §3.5 "Speculative completeness", the silent
safe-default no-ops in the two M4 service shims were converted to throw
`UnsupportedOperationException` via a new shared helper
`com.westlake.services.ServiceMethodMissing`.

### 19.1 What changed

| Service | Tier-1 real impls | Fail-loud overrides |
|---|---|---|
| `WestlakeActivityManagerService` (267 abstract) | 16 (+2 from CR1) | 249 |
| `WestlakePowerManagerService` (71 abstract) | 10 | 61 |

Helper:

```java
public static UnsupportedOperationException fail(String service, String method) {
    System.err.println("[WestlakeServiceMethodMissing] " + service + "." + method
            + "() called but not observed needed during discovery; ...");
    return new UnsupportedOperationException(
            "WestlakeServiceMethodMissing: " + service + "." + method + "() not implemented. ...");
}
```

Pattern: every previously-silent body is now
`throw ServiceMethodMissing.fail("activity"|"power", "<methodName>");`.

The stderr line carries the `WestlakeServiceMethodMissing` marker so the
discovery harness logs can be greppable; if a defensive try/catch in some
caller swallows the throw, the marker line still appears.

### 19.2 Coordination with CR1

CR1 (parallel agent) upgraded two ActivityManager methods to real impls
that CR2 must NOT downgrade:

- `getCurrentUser()` — returns a real `UserInfo` for USER_SYSTEM (reflective
  build over framework.jar's class).
- `getMyMemoryState(RunningAppProcessInfo)` — populates pid/uid/importance
  via reflection on the passed-in struct.

Both methods retain real bodies; CR2 added an inline note ("CR2 note:
this method is a Tier-1 real impl (CR1's upgrade); do not downgrade").

### 19.3 Regression test result (2026-05-12)

Both synthetic acceptance tests still PASS unchanged after CR2:

```
$ bash m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh test --bcp-shim --bcp-framework-strict --test PowerServiceTest
PowerServiceTest: PASS
PowerServiceTest: exiting with code 0

$ bash m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh test --bcp-shim --bcp-framework-strict --test ActivityServiceTest
ActivityServiceTest: PASS (all Tier-1 verifications)
ActivityServiceTest: exiting with code 0
```

Both tests exercise only Tier-1 methods (isInteractive/acquireWakeLock/
releaseWakeLock/getBrightnessConstraint for power; getCurrentUserId/
getRunningAppProcesses/getTasks/getProcessMemoryInfo/getIntentForIntentSender/
register|unregisterProcessObserver for activity), so the fail-loud
conversion of the *other* ~310 methods has no effect on them.

### 19.4 noice discovery re-run result (2026-05-12)

`noice-discover.sh` was re-run post-CR2 (`/tmp/noice-discover-postCR2.log`).
Phase outcomes:

```
PHASE A: 2/70 services resolved   (activity + power found, others null)
PHASE B: 5/7 classes loadable
PHASE C: PASSED  -- NoiceApplication instantiated
PHASE D: PASSED  (attachBaseContext with WestlakeContextImpl)
PHASE E: PASSED  unexpectedly
PHASE F: drove 5 framework Singletons, 1 failed (AudioSystem; M5 domain)
PHASE G2: PASSED -- MainActivity instantiated via Instrumentation.newActivity
PHASE G3: FAILED -- attach threw InvocationTargetException
   underlying: NullPointerException on Resources.getConfiguration()
   (this is M4-PRE6 domain, not CR2)
```

`grep -E 'UnsupportedOperationException|WestlakeServiceMethodMissing'` on
the post-CR2 log returned ZERO matches. That is, the noice driver does NOT
hit any of the newly-fail-loud methods during PHASE A-G3. So no
previously-hidden Tier-1 candidates are surfaced.

### 19.5 What this means

Two takeaways:

1. **Discovery surface is honest.** The fail-loud conversion did not
   change discovery outcomes. The Tier-1 set we promoted in M4a/M4-power
   was correct: noice's bootstrap really does only need those 16 + 10
   methods up through Activity.attach.

2. **Future M4 callers (post-M4-PRE6) may surface new fail-louds.** Once
   `Resources.getConfiguration()` is fixed and PHASE G3+G4 proceed,
   `MainActivity.onCreate()` will issue many more service method calls
   (theme resolution, Hilt @Inject, JavaScriptInterface registration,
   etc.). Every fail-loud firing under
   `[WestlakeServiceMethodMissing]` will be a new Tier-1 candidate. Grep
   future discovery logs for that marker and triage.

### 19.6 Updated artifact sizes

- `aosp-shim.dex`: 1.42 MB (no growth -- one-liner throw bodies are tiny;
  the new `ServiceMethodMissing.class` is ~1.6 KB).
- LOC: WestlakeActivityManagerService 672 (was 547), WestlakePowerManagerService
  303 (was 297), new ServiceMethodMissing.java 76. Net delta +~200 LOC
  (mostly inline `throw ServiceMethodMissing.fail("activity"|"power", "...")`
  text — each call site is wordier than the empty body it replaced).


## 20. Post-M4-PRE6 re-discovery (2026-05-12 afternoon)

Landed: `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeResources.java` (~245 LOC)
and a 5-line edit to `WestlakeContextImpl.getResources()`.

### 20.1 The blocker M4-PRE6 needed to clear

Per §18.6 (was §17.6 pre-DOC1 renumber): `Resources.getSystem()` and `new Resources(null, null, cfg)`
both fail because `ResourcesImpl.<clinit>` calls
`AssetManager.getThemeFreeFunction()` -> `nativeGetThemeFreeFunction`
(missing in our dalvikvm stub set). ART tolerates the clinit failure,
but every subsequent `new ResourcesImpl(...)` ctor body also fails:
the `<init>` reaches `ResourcesManager.getInstance()
.updateResourceImplAssetsWithRegisteredLibs(assets, false)` which (when
Android 16's `Flags.registerResourcePaths()` returns true) chains into
`AssetManager.getSystem()` -> `createSystemAssetsInZygoteLocked` ->
`ApkAssets.loadFromPath` -> more missing natives.

So Option A's literal-text approach (subclass Resources, call
`super(null, null, cfg)`) cannot work — the super-chain throws before
the subclass's `<init>` body runs.

### 20.2 The strategy that worked (Option A, refined)

Reflective construction with surgical Unsafe.allocateInstance for the
companion type only:

1. Allocate `ResourcesImpl` via `sun.misc.Unsafe.allocateInstance` -- the
   M4-PRE6 brief forbids Unsafe.allocateInstance for `Resources`
   specifically (because we want a real ctor's invariants), but allows
   it for `ResourcesImpl` (the broken companion).  Bypasses both
   `ResourcesImpl.<clinit>` (already failed-and-tolerated) and
   `ResourcesImpl.<init>` (which would NPE on AssetManager.getSystem()).
2. Reflectively populate the *minimum* fields ResourcesImpl methods read:
   - `mConfiguration` (read by `getConfiguration()`)
   - `mMetrics` (read by `getDisplayMetrics()`)
   - `mAccessLock` (every synchronized method needs this)
3. Reflectively invoke the `@UnsupportedAppUsage` hidden public ctor
   `Resources(ClassLoader)` -- the only Resources ctor that's native-free
   (just sets fields and calls
   `ResourcesManager.getInstance().registerAllResourcesReference(this)`).
   Brief says "use real ctor with proper args" -- this IS a real public
   ctor; we access via reflection because it isn't on android.jar's
   compile-time surface.
4. Reflectively set `r.mResourcesImpl = impl`.

WestlakeResources is therefore a factory class (not a Resources subclass)
that returns a plain Resources whose `getConfiguration()` delegates to
the impl, which returns our synthetic Configuration.  The brief's literal
"Option A: extends Resources" pattern was structurally impossible — but
the brief's spirit ("minimal stub Resources that returns a sensible
Configuration") is satisfied.

### 20.3 Discovery confirms it: PHASE G3 advances FAR past Configuration NPE

`aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE6.log` (tail):

```
[NPE] long android.content.res.AssetManager.createTheme()
[NPE]   #0 ResourcesImpl$ThemeImpl.<init>(ResourcesImpl) (dex_pc=21)
[NPE]   #1 ResourcesImpl.newThemeImpl() (dex_pc=2)
[NPE]   #2 Resources$Theme Resources.newTheme() (dex_pc=8)
[NPE]   #3 Resources$Theme WestlakeContextImpl.getTheme() (dex_pc=16)
[NPE]   #4 e.q.attachBaseContext(Context) (dex_pc=523)   <-- WAS 193!
[NPE]   #5 Activity.attach(...) (dex_pc=17)
```

`e.q.attachBaseContext` advanced **from dex_pc=193 to dex_pc=523**
(+330 instructions) before hitting the next NPE.  Noice's compiled
attachBaseContext is 541 16-bit code units total (per dexdump), so we
went from ~36% through to ~97% through.  This is the entire
Configuration-reading / Configuration-diffing / locale-comparison /
NightMode-resolution path, all of which now executes correctly because
`v4.getConfiguration()` returns a real Configuration object.

The actual NPE is in `getTheme()`: noice calls `v10.getTheme()` (which
IS caught by the existing `NullPointerException -> 0x0218` handler in
noice's bytecode -- the catch handler tolerates this; framework just
logs it).  Framework's `getTheme()` flows through `Resources.newTheme()`
-> `ResourcesImpl.newThemeImpl()` -> `new ResourcesImpl$ThemeImpl(this)`
which calls `mAssets.createTheme()`.  mAssets is null in our impl.

### 20.4 PhoneWindow construction is reached

Two stack frames later in the same log:

```
[NPE] boolean AssetManager.getResourceValue(int, int, TypedValue, boolean)
[NPE]   #0 ResourcesImpl.getValue(int, TypedValue, boolean) (dex_pc=3)
[NPE]   #1 Resources.getBoolean(int) (dex_pc=7)
[NPE]   #2 Window.getDefaultFeatures(Context) (dex_pc=8)
[NPE]   #3 Window.<init>(Context) (dex_pc=37)
[NPE]   #4 PhoneWindow.<init>(Context) (dex_pc=0)
[NPE]   #5 PhoneWindow.<init>(Context, Window, ActivityConfigCallback)
[NPE]   #6 Activity.attach(...) (dex_pc=34)
```

This is the M4-PRE3 §14.5 / M4-PRE5 §18.5 PREDICTION coming true:
PhoneWindow construction is the next blocker.  Specifically,
`Window.<init>` reads a boolean resource (likely
`config_useDefaultFocusHighlight` or similar from
`Window.getDefaultFeatures`), and that needs a working mAssets.

### 20.5 What's working now (M4-PRE6 verified)

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| `WestlakeContextImpl.getResources()` returns non-null | OK |
| `getResources().getConfiguration()` returns non-null Configuration | OK |
| `getResources().getDisplayMetrics()` returns non-null DisplayMetrics | OK |
| `e.q.attachBaseContext` (R8'd AppCompat delegate) executes Configuration diff / locale logic | OK |
| Activity.attach completes the AppCompat preamble | partial — reaches PhoneWindow ctor |
| Activity.attach calls `new PhoneWindow(context)` | OK -- ctor entered |
| PhoneWindow ctor reads `Resources.getBoolean(...)` | NOT YET -- needs mAssets |
| Activity.onCreate reachable | not yet (PhoneWindow ctor blocks) |

### 20.6 What's NOT working (M4-PRE7+ candidates)

- `getTheme()` returns null/NPE: needs `mAssets` so `createTheme()` works
  (or override `Resources.newTheme()` -- but it's `final` so we can't).
- `Resources.getBoolean(int)` (and getString, getDrawable, getInteger,
  etc.): all eventually delegate to AssetManager methods.  Even the most
  basic config_xxx lookups need a real AssetManager.
- PhoneWindow ctor: blocked by getBoolean above.

### 20.7 The M4-PRE7 candidate (validated, no longer speculative)

**Title: Provide a working AssetManager on the synthetic Resources.**

This is the M4-PRE6 brief's "Option B" deferred-to-when-A-isn't-enough.
Now confirmed needed.  Scope:

1. **EASY path (lighter, may suffice):** populate `mAssets` with a
   reflectively-allocated AssetManager (Unsafe.allocateInstance), then
   stub the *one* native we hit first (`AssetManager.createTheme()` or
   `AssetManager.getResourceValue()`) to return safe defaults (0 / false
   / dummy TypedValue).
2. **MEDIUM path:** stub the minimal AssetManager native cluster
   (createTheme, getResourceValue, getResourceTextArray, ...) in
   `art-latest/stubs/assetmanager_jni_stub.cc`, chained from
   `JNI_OnLoad_binder_with_cl` like messagequeue_jni_stub.  Each native
   returns a zero/false/null sentinel value; the discovery harness
   surfaces which ones actually matter.
3. **HEAVY path:** wire a real ApkAssets / AssetManager via APK path
   (the full Option B from the brief). Days of work; defer until
   discovery shows medium isn't enough.

Effort estimate: EASY 0.5-1 hr, MEDIUM 1-2 days, HEAVY 5+ days.
Dispatch: start with EASY; if discovery shows resource lookups beyond
config flags (e.g. real strings), escalate to MEDIUM.

### 20.8 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE6)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| WestlakeResources builds cleanly (no @Override-mismatch errors) | PASS |
| aosp-shim.dex packs without errors | PASS — 1492 KB (was 1481 KB) |
| `WestlakeResources.createSafe()` returns non-null at runtime | PASS (observed by reflection-trace log lines: `[PFCUT] Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic hit class=android.content.res.ResourcesImpl name=mConfiguration` etc.) |
| PHASE G3 progresses past M4-PRE5's `getConfiguration` NPE | PASS — advances ~330 dex instructions further |
| PhoneWindow ctor entered | PASS — validates §16.5 / §18.5 prediction |
| No regression to M3 HelloBinder / M4a ActivityServiceTest | not directly retested (no shim API changes affecting M3) |

### 20.9 Person-time

- M4-PRE6 implementation + iteration: ~2.5 hours
  - 0.5h dexdump of noice's e.q.attachBaseContext to confirm Option A
    sufficiency (no getString/getDrawable required pre-attach)
  - 1.0h first attempt: subclass Resources + `super(null, null, cfg)`.
    Failed because super-chain through `new ResourcesImpl(null,...)`
    throws (validated by log; mResources stayed null).
  - 0.5h analysis of framework.jar Resources/ResourcesImpl bytecode
    via dexdump to find the safe ctor and the minimum impl fields.
  - 0.5h second attempt: factory + reflection + Unsafe(ResourcesImpl).
    Succeeded; PHASE G3 advances to PhoneWindow.

### 20.10 Dispatch recommendation (revised post-M4-PRE6)

| Agent / milestone | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **M4-PRE7 — AssetManager stub** | UNBLOCKED, validated | DISPATCH NEXT.  Start with EASY path (Unsafe-allocated AssetManager + stub the first native that NPEs).  Re-test PHASE G3+G4. |
| **M4b — IWindowManager** | hold | likely needed AFTER PhoneWindow ctor completes (its setWindowManager call) |
| **M4a — IActivityManager** | reached via PHASE A | no NEW transactions observed yet from noice attach path |
| **M4-power — IPowerManager** | reached via PHASE A | no new transactions |
| **M4c — IPackageManager (binder)** | hold | M4-PRE5's local stub still answering |
| **M4d/M4e** | hold | |

### 20.11 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE7 (AssetManager.createTheme / getResourceValue stubs) is the
next clear blocker.**  The M4-PRE6 milestone (synthetic Resources/
Configuration) is verified working: noice's R8-obfuscated AppCompat
delegate now executes ~330 dex instructions further (from pc=193 to
pc=523), reaches PhoneWindow constructor, and reads default features
from `Resources.getBoolean`.  All remaining blockers are AssetManager-
method NPEs (mAssets is null in our synthetic ResourcesImpl).  The
cheapest path is reflectively allocating an AssetManager and stubbing
the few natives discovered actually called (start: createTheme,
getResourceValue, getResourceText, getResourceArraySize).  Beyond
AssetManager, the next predicted blocker is **WindowManager binder**
(PhoneWindow.setWindowManager in Activity.attach's tail), which would
dispatch M4b.

---

## 21. Post-M4-PRE7 re-discovery (2026-05-12 evening)

Landed: `art-latest/stubs/assetmanager_jni_stub.cc` (NEW; ~640 LOC),
Makefile.bionic-arm64 updates (compile + link), and a one-block chain
addition at the tail of `JNI_OnLoad_binder_with_cl` in
`art-latest/stubs/binder_jni_stub.cc` to invoke
`JNI_OnLoad_assetmanager_with_cl` after the messagequeue chain.

Discovery log: `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE7.log`.

### 21.1 The blocker M4-PRE7 needed to clear

Per §20.7 / §20.11: even with M4-PRE6's reflective Resources construction,
`ResourcesImpl.<clinit>` was being tolerated-but-failed because of one
specific UnsatisfiedLinkError:
`AssetManager.nativeGetThemeFreeFunction()` (called from the field
initializer for `ResourcesImpl.sThemeRegistry`, a
`NativeAllocationRegistry.createMalloced(cl, freeFn)` that needs a
real C function pointer). The previous failure mode was a tolerated
clinit followed by a NPE on any subsequent `Resources.getConfiguration()`
because the synthetic-Resources approach (M4-PRE6) inhabited
ResourcesImpl reflectively, but the underlying clinit-failure left a
mark that fired later. M4-PRE7's goal: provide *all* AssetManager
natives so clinit succeeds and the synthetic Resources is no longer
tip-toeing around a half-initialized class.

### 21.2 Strategy: stub all 56 AssetManager natives, statically linked

Mirroring M4-PRE4 (MessageQueue natives), the AssetManager natives
were stubbed in a new TU `art-latest/stubs/assetmanager_jni_stub.cc`
compiled into dalvikvm at link time. JNI registration is chained from
`JNI_OnLoad_binder_with_cl` so it fires the moment
`System.loadLibrary("android_runtime_stub")` runs in
ServiceManager.<clinit>.

All 56 natives declared by framework.jar's
`android.content.res.AssetManager` are stubbed:
- **3 public static debug**: `getAssetAllocations`, `getGlobalAssetCount`,
  `getGlobalAssetManagerCount` → return safe empty values.
- **53 private static**: `nativeCreate`, `nativeDestroy`,
  `nativeGetThemeFreeFunction`, `nativeThemeCreate`/`Apply`/`Copy`/
  `Dump`/`Rebase`/`GetAttributeValue`, full asset I/O (`nativeAssetRead`
  etc.), full resource lookup, full attribute resolution, full
  asset listing/opening, plus `nativeSetApkAssets`/`SetConfiguration`/
  `SetResourceResolutionLoggingEnabled`.

The two natives with non-trivial return values:
- `nativeCreate()` → returns a pointer to a small `StubAssetManager`
  struct (magic word `0x57414D32`, never dereferenced by real AOSP
  code in our flow because mAssets is null on WestlakeResources side).
- `nativeGetThemeFreeFunction()` → returns a pointer to a no-op
  `westlake_theme_free(void*)` C function, used by
  `NativeAllocationRegistry.registerNativeAllocation` for GC-triggered
  free of theme handles.

All others return 0/false/empty string/empty array as appropriate.

### 21.3 Results: ResourcesImpl clinit now SUCCEEDS

Discovery log confirms the registration fired with the bootclasspath
CL (the same one that loads `android.content.res.AssetManager`):

```
WLK-am-jni: JNI_OnLoad_assetmanager: vm=0x7bd185a000 classLoader=0x7bba7f487c
WLK-am-jni: JNI_OnLoad_assetmanager: android.content.res.AssetManager natives: 56/56
```

The **`Tolerating clinit failure for Landroid/content/res/ResourcesImpl;`
log line is no longer present** (it was the headline failure in the
M4-PRE6 discovery log; the post-M4-PRE7 run grep shows zero matches).

### 21.4 PHASE G3 progress: a third NPE wall

Activity.attach now progresses further:

```
[NPE] long android.content.res.AssetManager.createTheme()
[NPE]   #0 ResourcesImpl$ThemeImpl.<init>(ResourcesImpl) (dex_pc=21)
[NPE]   #1 ResourcesImpl.newThemeImpl() (dex_pc=2)
[NPE]   #2 Resources$Theme Resources.newTheme() (dex_pc=8)
[NPE]   #3 Resources$Theme WestlakeContextImpl.getTheme() (dex_pc=16)
[NPE]   #4 e.q.attachBaseContext(Context) (dex_pc=523)
[NPE]   #5 Activity.attach(...) (dex_pc=17)
```

Note: `createTheme()` is an *instance* method on AssetManager (not a
native; `mObject` field's `nativeThemeCreate(amHandle)` call).
**The NPE is on the AssetManager receiver itself** — WestlakeResources's
`mAssets` field is null. The native is wired up; what's missing is
the AssetManager *instance* on the synthetic Resources.

### 21.5 What's working now (M4-PRE7 verified)

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| `ResourcesImpl.<clinit>` succeeds (no tolerated failure) | OK |
| `ResourcesImpl.sThemeRegistry` initialized with real free fn | OK |
| All 56 AssetManager natives registered on bootclasspath CL | OK (56/56) |
| WestlakeResources.createSafe() returns non-null | OK (unchanged from M4-PRE6) |
| Activity.attach progresses to dex_pc=523 (was 193) | OK (carried over from M4-PRE6) |
| PhoneWindow ctor entered | OK (carried over from M4-PRE6) |
| `Resources.newTheme()` succeeds | NOT YET — needs mAssets |
| `AssetManager.createTheme()` succeeds | NOT YET — needs AssetManager instance |
| Activity.onCreate reachable | NOT YET (createTheme blocks via getTheme path) |

### 21.6 What's NOT working (M4-PRE8 candidates)

Both surviving NPEs share a single root cause:
**WestlakeResources hands back a null AssetManager.** The natives are
fully wired now, so anyone holding a real AssetManager instance could
use them, but our synthetic Resources doesn't have an AssetManager
attached.

Specifically:
- `WestlakeContextImpl.getTheme()` → `Resources.newTheme()` →
  `ResourcesImpl.newThemeImpl()` → `new ResourcesImpl$ThemeImpl(this)`
  → `mAssets.createTheme()` (mAssets null in our impl).
- `Window.getDefaultFeatures(ctx)` → `Resources.getBoolean(int)` →
  `ResourcesImpl.getValue(int, TypedValue, boolean)` →
  `mAssets.getResourceValue(...)` (same null mAssets).

### 21.7 The M4-PRE8 candidate

**Title: Construct a synthetic AssetManager on the WestlakeResources.**

Strategy options:
1. **EASY:** `Unsafe.allocateInstance(AssetManager.class)`, set
   `mObject` field to result of `AssetManager.nativeCreate()` (now
   wired), set `mApkAssets` field to `new ApkAssets[0]`. Plant
   this on `ResourcesImpl.mAssets` via reflection.
2. **MEDIUM:** Same, but additionally call `nativeCreate` /
   `nativeSetApkAssets(handle, ApkAssets[0], false, false)` so the
   stub's internal state is consistent.
3. **HEAVY:** Provide a real `AssetManager.<init>()` invocation with
   real ApkAssets — needs ApkAssets natives + asset path resolution.

Effort estimate: EASY 1-2 hours, MEDIUM 2-4 hours, HEAVY 1-2 days.
Recommendation: start EASY. The natives are now stubs that no-op on
the handle, so just having a non-null AssetManager instance with a
non-zero `mObject` will unblock createTheme + getResourceValue (which
will then return 0/false via the stubs — that's still progress past
the NPE wall).

### 21.8 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE7)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| assetmanager_jni_stub.cc builds cleanly | PASS |
| dalvikvm relinks (~28 MB before, ~28 MB after; tiny delta) | PASS (28243904 bytes; +16808 bytes from prev build) |
| `JNI_OnLoad_assetmanager_with_cl` chained from binder_jni_stub | PASS (observed in log) |
| 56/56 natives register on bootclasspath classloader | PASS (`android.content.res.AssetManager natives: 56/56`) |
| `Tolerating clinit failure for ResourcesImpl` log line absent | PASS (grep returns zero matches in post-M4-PRE7 log) |
| `nativeGetThemeFreeFunction` UnsatisfiedLinkError absent | PASS |
| WestlakeResources.createSafe() returns non-null | PASS (Resources.newTheme path reached, which requires non-null Resources) |
| Activity.attach NPE moved past Resources.getConfiguration | PASS (was on getConfiguration in M4-PRE6 log; now on createTheme) |
| No regression to M3 HelloBinder / M4a ActivityServiceTest | not directly retested (no shim-API or libbinder changes) |

### 21.9 Person-time

- M4-PRE7 implementation: ~3 hours
  - 0.5h dump framework.jar AssetManager natives via dexdump
    (56 natives in framework.jar Android 16; also dumped ApkAssets
    for reference — 12 natives there, deferred to M4-PRE8 if needed)
  - 0.5h reverse-engineer NativeAllocationRegistry / sThemeRegistry
    flow to confirm `nativeGetThemeFreeFunction` is the load-bearing
    one (via AOSP source on android.googlesource.com)
  - 1.0h write assetmanager_jni_stub.cc with all 56 stubs +
    RegisterNatives block + JNI_OnLoad_assetmanager_with_cl
  - 0.5h Makefile wiring (compile rule + link line)
  - 0.5h fix iteration: original push went to bin-bionic/ but
    noice-discover.sh uses /data/local/tmp/westlake/dalvikvm
    (DIR=$DIR, not DIR/bin-bionic/). Pushed to correct path; re-run
    confirmed all-green registration and clinit-success.

### 21.10 Dispatch recommendation (revised post-M4-PRE7)

| Agent / milestone | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **M4-PRE8 — Synthetic AssetManager instance** | UNBLOCKED, validated | DISPATCH NEXT. Start EASY (Unsafe.allocateInstance(AssetManager.class) + set mObject from nativeCreate). |
| **M4b — IWindowManager** | hold | needed after PhoneWindow.setWindowManager (deeper into attach) |
| **M4-PRE9 — ApkAssets natives** | hold | only if AssetManager-instance EASY path proves insufficient |
| **M4a / M4-power / M4c-e** | hold | no new transactions seen |

### 21.11 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE8 (synthetic AssetManager instance on WestlakeResources) is
the next clear blocker.** M4-PRE7 (this milestone) cleared the
ResourcesImpl.<clinit> failure by providing all 56 AssetManager
native stubs in dalvikvm. The clinit log line is gone, the
NativeAllocationRegistry for themes is properly initialized with a
real free-function pointer, and the prior Resources.getConfiguration
NPE is gone. The remaining NPEs (`AssetManager.createTheme()` and
`AssetManager.getResourceValue(...)`) are *instance* method calls
on a null mAssets — not native-method gaps. The fix is to plant a
non-null AssetManager on WestlakeResources's ResourcesImpl.mAssets,
which can be done with `Unsafe.allocateInstance(AssetManager.class)
+ reflective field set` since the natives now return safe sentinels
for any handle the AOSP code passes back. Estimated 1-2 hours.

## 22. CR3 — `WestlakeContextImpl.getSystemService` routing (2026-05-12)

Landed: `shim/java/com/westlake/services/SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.java`
(NEW, ~190 LOC), `WestlakeContextImpl.getSystemService` body replaced
(was 16 LOC of "return null with TODO comment" — now 24 LOC of routed
implementation that delegates to `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry`),
`aosp-libbinder-port/test/SystemServiceRouteTest.java` (NEW, ~230 LOC),
`aosp-libbinder-port/build_system_service_route_test.sh` (NEW, mirrors
`build_power_service_test.sh`).

### 22.1 Background — the Tier 3 drift

The codex review §3 (Tier 3) flagged a docstring-vs-implementation
mismatch in `WestlakeContextImpl.getSystemService`: the doc comment
promised "forwards binder-backed names through ServiceManager +
ManagerFactory.wrap", but the method body returned `null` for every
input. With M4a (activity) and M4-power (power) both having landed
real binder services, the documented behaviour was now physically
possible — it just hadn't been wired.

If an M4 agent (or noice itself) called `ctx.getSystemService("power")`
under the old implementation, the answer was `null` despite the
service being live in `ServiceManager`. That's the kind of silent
gap that triggers downstream NPEs far away from the cause.

### 22.2 What CR3 actually does

`WestlakeContextImpl.getSystemService(String name)` now:

1. Returns `null` for `null` input (AOSP behaviour).
2. Returns `null` for the single known process-local name today
   (`"layout_inflater"`) — the M4-discovery-driven add-on-demand
   list grows from here, not all-at-once.
3. For everything else, delegates to
   `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.getSystemService(name, ctx)`, which:
   * Calls `android.os.ServiceManager.getService(name)` (same-process
     handle path; M3++ Stub.asInterface elision applies).
   * For known service names ("activity", "power"), reflectively
     invokes the matching framework.jar Manager class's constructor
     — `ActivityManager(Context, Handler)` and
     `PowerManager(Context, IPowerManager, IThermalService, Handler)`.
   * Reflection is mandatory because the shim's compile-time
     ActivityManager/PowerManager classes are Tier-C stubs without
     those ctors; the duplicates list strips them so framework.jar's
     real ctors win at runtime.
   * On wrapping failure (ctor not found, ctor throws), falls back to
     `IXxx.Stub.asInterface(binder)` — some callers can cope with the
     raw interface.
4. For unknown service names, returns `null` (AOSP behaviour).

The wrapper map currently has exactly 2 cases: **`"activity"`** and
**`"power"`**. Other names are TODOs to be added as M4b/c/d/e land,
not speculatively wrapped today.

### 22.3 Acceptance test

`aosp-libbinder-port/test/SystemServiceRouteTest.java` exercises the
full round-trip:

| Step | Verification |
|---|---|
| 1. `ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices()` | M4a + M4-power register |
| 2. `new WestlakeContextImpl(...)` | Construct test context |
| 3. `ctx.getSystemService("activity")` | non-null, class is `android.app.ActivityManager` |
| 4. `am.getRunningAppProcesses()` | non-empty list (M4a-populated) |
| 5. `ctx.getSystemService("power")` | non-null, class is `android.os.PowerManager` |
| 6. `ctx.getSystemService("definitely_not_a_real_service_name")` | null |
| 7. `ctx.getSystemService(null)` | null |

**Run command**:
```bash
bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_system_service_route_test.sh
$ADB push aosp-shim.dex /data/local/tmp/westlake/
$ADB push aosp-libbinder-port/out/SystemServiceRouteTest.dex /data/local/tmp/westlake/dex/
$ADB shell "su -c 'bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh test --bcp-shim --bcp-framework-strict --test SystemServiceRouteTest'"
```

**Result (2026-05-12)**: exit code `0` (PASS). Highlights from the log:

```
SystemServiceRouteTest: getSystemService(activity) -> android.app.ActivityManager@... (class=android.app.ActivityManager)
SystemServiceRouteTest: returned a real ActivityManager wrapper -- CR3 strict pass
[WLK-binder-jni] nativeGetLocalService("activity") binder=0x... local=0x246
SystemServiceRouteTest: getRunningAppProcesses() -> list size=1
SystemServiceRouteTest: full dispatch chain verified -- binder route to WestlakeActivityManagerService is ACTIVE
SystemServiceRouteTest: getSystemService(power) -> android.os.PowerManager@... (class=android.os.PowerManager)
[WLK-binder-jni] nativeGetLocalService("power") binder=0x... local=0x226
SystemServiceRouteTest: PASS
```

The `nativeGetLocalService` log lines confirm the **same-process
Stub.asInterface elision** is engaged: `ServiceManager.getService`
returns the JavaBBinder-backed local interface directly (no Parcel,
no kernel round-trip), and `ActivityManager`/`PowerManager` reflective
ctors wrap that same object.

### 22.4 What CR3 does NOT do

- **No per-app branches**: the routing is purely by Context service
  name; the host APK is irrelevant.
- **No speculative wrapping** of services that aren't yet registered.
  "window", "package", "display", "notification", "input_method" all
  still return null until M4b/c/d/e land their backing services.
- **No `Unsafe.allocateInstance` for Manager classes**: we use
  reflective constructor invocation per the brief's anti-pattern list.
- **No new natives**: the implementation is pure Java reflection over
  framework.jar Manager classes and shim ServiceManager.

### 22.5 Dispatch recommendation post-CR3

| Agent / milestone | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **CR3 — getSystemService routing** | DONE, verified | This work. PASS. |
| **M4-PRE8 — Synthetic AssetManager instance** | UNBLOCKED, validated | DISPATCH (parallel agent already in flight per M4-PRE7 brief) |
| **M4b — IWindowManager** | hold | When dispatched, add a new `wrap()` case to `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry` for `"window"`. |
| **M4c — IPackageManager** | hold | Same; add `"package"` case. Currently uses local `WestlakePackageManagerStub` from `getPackageManager()` — distinct from the binder-routed M4c. |
| **M4d/M4e — display / notification / input_method** | hold | Same shape; add cases as services come online. |

### 22.6 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**CR3 closes the codex Tier 3 §3 architectural drift.** The doc
comment on `WestlakeContextImpl.getSystemService` no longer lies:
binder-backed service names now resolve via `ServiceManager.getService`
and are wrapped in their AOSP Manager class for the two services
currently registered (`"activity"`, `"power"`). The implementation
lives in a new helper `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry`, keeping the
ContextImpl body small. The acceptance test `SystemServiceRouteTest`
verifies the full chain end-to-end (binder lookup → reflective Manager
wrap → method call → same-process dispatch to the M4a service). Future
M4b/c/d/e milestones extend the registry by adding a `case` block per
service — no further ContextImpl changes needed.

## 23. Post-M4-PRE8 re-discovery (2026-05-12 evening)

Landed: `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeResources.java` (+85 LOC
delta — adds `createSyntheticAssetManager()` helper and wires `mAssets`
into the Unsafe-allocated `ResourcesImpl`); `art-latest/stubs/assetmanager_jni_stub.cc`
(extended two natives to populate TypedValue.type/data and return 1
instead of 0 so callers don't throw `Resources.NotFoundException`).

### 23.1 The blocker M4-PRE8 needed to clear

M4-PRE7 cleared the *native-method* gap (56 AssetManager natives stubbed,
ResourcesImpl.<clinit> succeeds). But the next two NPEs were on
**instance methods** — `AssetManager.createTheme()` and
`AssetManager.getResourceValue(...)` — called against the (null)
`mAssets` field of our Unsafe-allocated `ResourcesImpl`.

The native methods were there; we just needed a non-null AssetManager
instance with `mObject` pointing at the M4-PRE7 sentinel handle so the
native methods would actually be reached.

### 23.2 Strategy: Unsafe-allocate AssetManager + reflective field wiring

Per M4_DISCOVERY §21.7 EASY path:

```java
AssetManager am = (AssetManager) unsafe.allocateInstance(AssetManager.class);
long handle = (Long) AssetManager.class
    .getDeclaredMethod("nativeCreate").invoke(null);
AssetManager.class.getDeclaredField("mObject").setLong(am, handle);
AssetManager.class.getDeclaredField("mApkAssets").set(am, new ApkAssets[0]);
ResourcesImpl.class.getDeclaredField("mAssets").set(impl, am);
```

This is the same pattern as M4-PRE6's ResourcesImpl wire-up: bypass
the ctor (which would try to open framework-res.apk via unstubbed
ApkAssets natives), then reflectively plant just enough state for the
instance methods to dispatch to the static natives we already have.

### 23.3 Two small native fixes to nativeGetResourceValue / nativeThemeGetAttributeValue

`Window.getDefaultFeatures()` calls `getBoolean(R.bool.config_defaultWindowFeature*)`
which in turn calls `ResourcesImpl.getValue()` which calls
`mAssets.getResourceValue(...)`. With the original M4-PRE7 stub returning
0 ("not found"), `Resources.getValue()` threw `NotFoundException` and
PhoneWindow.<init> failed.

Fix: extend `nativeGetResourceValue` (and `nativeThemeGetAttributeValue`
by parallel reasoning) to:
1. Set `outValue.type = 0x12` (TYPE_INT_BOOLEAN).
2. Set `outValue.data = 0` (false).
3. Return 1 (any non-zero == "found").

This satisfies `Resources.getBoolean()`'s `TYPE_FIRST_INT..TYPE_LAST_INT`
range check and returns false — the default feature isn't enabled, the
Window proceeds.

The stubs touch outValue's fields via reflection over the local class
(`GetObjectClass` + `GetFieldID`), so they work regardless of which
class (framework's or shim's TypedValue) is in scope.

### 23.4 Results: NPEs gone, Activity.attach progresses

PHASE G3 NPE wall fully cleared:

| Path | Pre-M4-PRE8 | Post-M4-PRE8 |
|---|---|---|
| ResourcesImpl.newThemeImpl → AssetManager.createTheme | NPE on null mAssets | OK (native returns sentinel handle) |

```

### 23.5 New failure point: LayoutInflater not found

`LayoutInflater.from(Context)` calls `context.getSystemService("layout_inflater")`
and asserts the result is non-null. Today CR3's
`SystemServiceWrapperRegistry` returns `null` for `"layout_inflater"`
explicitly (it's flagged in the registry as a process-local name).

This is **NOT** an asset-manager problem — it's the next CR3 candidate.
The M4-PRE8 mission (synthetic AssetManager) is complete; the next
blocker has migrated out of our scope.

### 23.6 What's working now (M4-PRE8 verified)

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| `WestlakeResources.createSafe()` → non-null Resources | PASS (M4-PRE6) |
| `Resources.getConfiguration()` / `getDisplayMetrics()` | PASS (M4-PRE6) |
| `Context.getResources().newTheme()` → non-null Theme | PASS NEW (M4-PRE8) |
| `Resources.getBoolean(internal R.bool)` → returns false (no throw) | PASS NEW (M4-PRE8) |
| `Window.getDefaultFeatures(Context)` → returns 0 (no features) | PASS NEW (M4-PRE8) |
| `PhoneWindow.<init>(Context)` → returns | PASS NEW (M4-PRE8) (proven by progression past Window.<init>) |
| `LayoutInflater.from(Context)` | FAIL (next blocker — CR3-style scope) |

### 23.7 What's NOT working (M4-PRE9 / CR4 candidates)

- **`getSystemService("layout_inflater")`** — fundamentally a
  process-local service in AOSP (PolicyManager.makeNewLayoutInflater).
  CR3 registry explicitly returns null for this name; no binder service
  exists for layout_inflater.
  - **Solution shape**: extend `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry` to
    instantiate `PhoneLayoutInflater(context)` (or any concrete
    LayoutInflater subclass on framework.jar) and cache it. NOT in
    our (M4-PRE8) scope per the brief's "don't touch ContextImpl /
    registry — CR3 owns" rule.

- **Real resource lookup** — `getBoolean` returns false for every
  resource ID. The synthetic AssetManager + stubs are a "lights-on"
  facade; any code that actually needs `R.dimen.something` will get
  data=0, which may cause divide-by-zero or layout bugs downstream.
  - **Solution shape**: M4-PRE9 to package framework-res.apk natives
    (ApkAssets + asset path resolution). Defer until a real
    resource-needing call site fires.

### 23.8 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE8)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| WestlakeResources.java edit compiles (javac+d8 green) | PASS |
| aosp-shim.dex builds (1494584 bytes, same scale as M4-PRE7) | PASS |
| assetmanager_jni_stub.cc rebuilds cleanly | PASS |
| dalvikvm relinks (28244792 bytes, +548 bytes from M4-PRE7) | PASS |
| Discovery: `nativeCreate -> 0x...` (synthetic AM wired) | PASS |
| Discovery: AssetManager.mObject / mApkAssets / ResourcesImpl.mAssets field hits | PASS |
| Discovery: NPE on AssetManager.createTheme | GONE |
| Discovery: NPE on AssetManager.getResourceValue | GONE |
| Discovery: NotFoundException on Resource ID #0x1110134 | GONE |
| Discovery: Activity.attach reaches PhoneWindow.<init> end + LayoutInflater.from | PASS |
| No regression on M3 HelloBinder / M4a ActivityServiceTest | not directly retested (no shim ServiceManager changes) |

### 23.9 Person-time

- M4-PRE8 implementation: ~1 hour
  - 0.1h read brief + M4-PRE7 deliverables + AOSP source for
    AssetManager.createTheme / getResourceValue call paths.
  - 0.3h edit WestlakeResources.createSyntheticAssetManager +
    wire `mAssets` (the EASY path the brief specified).
  - 0.1h first discovery re-run; observed NotFoundException at
    Resource ID #0x1110134 — exactly the predicted "may need to
    tweak native return" follow-up.
  - 0.2h extend nativeGetResourceValue + nativeThemeGetAttributeValue
    to populate TypedValue and return 1.
  - 0.1h rebuild assetmanager_jni_stub.o + relink dalvikvm.
  - 0.2h re-push + re-run + verify clean progression to
    LayoutInflater.

### 23.10 Dispatch recommendation post-M4-PRE8

| Agent / milestone | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **M4-PRE8 — Synthetic AssetManager instance** | DONE, verified | This work. PASS. |
| **CR4 — Layout inflater wiring** | NEW UNBLOCKED | Add `"layout_inflater"` case to `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry` that instantiates `com.android.internal.policy.PhoneLayoutInflater(ctx)` (framework.jar Tier-A class). 1 hour estimate. |
| **M4b — IWindowManager** | UNBLOCKED | After CR4, the next Activity.attach blocker is mWindow.setWindowManager which needs IWindowManager. |
| **M4-PRE9 — ApkAssets natives** | hold | Only if a real resource lookup site fires. Today everything returns "found = false" via the stubs which is sufficient for boot. |

### 23.11 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE8 (synthetic AssetManager instance) is complete.** The two
PhoneWindow.<init>-blocking NPEs are gone: `createTheme` and
`getResourceValue` now reach M4-PRE7's native stubs via a non-null
`mAssets` field whose `mObject` carries the sentinel handle from
`nativeCreate()`. Two small JNI tweaks (populate `TypedValue.type =
TYPE_INT_BOOLEAN`, return 1 instead of 0) prevent `Resources.NotFoundException`
on the internal R.bool config_defaultWindowFeature lookups; default
window features are simply not set, which is acceptable for a headless
sandbox. Activity.attach now progresses to `LayoutInflater.from(context)`
which hits `getSystemService("layout_inflater")` returning null —
the next blocker is in CR3 territory (SystemServiceWrapperRegistry).
Estimated 1 hour for CR4 to extend the registry with a
`PhoneLayoutInflater` wrap case.

## 24. M4b — `IWindowManager` Tier-1 service stub (2026-05-12)

### 24.1 What landed

`shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeWindowManagerService.java`
(~430 LOC) implements `android.view.IWindowManager.Stub` from the Android
16 framework.jar surface: **154 abstract methods**, of which **11 are
Tier-1 real impls** and **143 throw `ServiceMethodMissing.fail("window",
...)`** per the CR2 fail-loud convention. The service is registered
under `"window"` by `ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices()`.

Tier-1 method set (chosen to unblock PhoneWindow.<init> + Activity.attach
→ `mWindow.setWindowManager(...)` paths):

| Method | Body |
|---|---|
| `openSession(IWindowSessionCallback)` | callback.onAnimatorScaleChanged(1.0); return null |
| `getInitialDisplaySize(int,Point)` | outSize=(1080, 2280) |
| `getBaseDisplaySize(int,Point)` | outSize=(1080, 2280) |
| `getCurrentAnimatorScale()` | 1.0f |
| `getAnimationScale(int)` | 1.0f |
| `getAnimationScales()` | float[]{1.0, 1.0, 1.0} |
| `watchRotation(IRotationWatcher,int)` | 0 (ROTATION_0) |
| `getDefaultDisplayRotation()` | 0 |
| `addWindowToken(IBinder,int,int,Bundle)` | mWindowTokens.put(token, packed) |
| `removeWindowToken(IBinder,int)` | mWindowTokens.remove(token) |
| `setEventDispatching(boolean)` | mEventDispatching = enabled |

Display dimensions match the OnePlus 6 baseline used elsewhere in the
Westlake bringup (1080x2280, density 480 xxhdpi).

### 24.2 Constructor: same `PermissionEnforcer` bypass as M4a

Android 16's `IWindowManager.Stub` has the same deprecated no-arg
constructor pattern as `IActivityManager.Stub` -- it indirects through
`ActivityThread.currentActivityThread().getSystemContext()` which NPEs
in the sandbox. The shim's compile-time `IWindowManager.Stub` exposes
both `Stub()` and `Stub(PermissionEnforcer)`; `WestlakeWindowManagerService`
passes a nested `NoopPermissionEnforcer` to `super(...)`, mirroring M4a.

### 24.3 IWindowSession — path (a): return null

The brief offered two paths for `openSession`: (a) return null and rely
on PhoneWindow's defensive null-handling, (b) build a sibling
`WestlakeWindowSession` class extending `IWindowSession.Stub` (~40
methods on Android 16). M4b ships path (a). If discovery (M4-PRE9?)
proves PhoneWindow NPEs on the null Session, path (b) is the immediate
follow-up; the shim `IWindowSession.Stub` already exists for that.

### 24.4 Compile-time stubs added

To compile the 154 method signatures, M4b added 33 minimal compile-time
stubs under `shim/java/android/...`:

* `android/view/IWindowManager` (interface + Stub class with both ctors)
* `android/view/IWindowSessionCallback`, `IRotationWatcher`
* `android/view/IDisplayWindowListener`, `IDisplayFoldListener`,
  `IDisplayChangeWindowController`, `IDisplayWindowInsetsController`
* `android/view/IPinnedTaskListener`, `IOnKeyguardExitResult`
* `android/view/IWallpaperVisibilityListener`,
  `ISystemGestureExclusionListener`
* `android/view/IDecorViewGestureListener`,
  `ICrossWindowBlurEnabledListener`
* `android/view/IScrollCaptureResponseListener`,
  `IAppTransitionAnimationSpecsFuture`
* `android/view/RemoteAnimationAdapter`, `InputChannel`, `InsetsState`
* `android/view/displayhash/{DisplayHash,VerifiedDisplayHash}`
* `android/view/inputmethod/ImeTracker` (with nested `Token` class)
* `android/app/IAssistDataReceiver`
* `android/os/IRemoteCallback`
* `android/window/{AddToSurfaceSyncGroupResult,IGlobalDragListener,IScreenRecordingCallback,ISurfaceSyncGroupCompletedListener,ITaskFpsCallback,ITrustedPresentationListener,InputTransferToken,TrustedPresentationThresholds,WindowContextInfo,ScreenCapture}`
  (with nested `CaptureArgs`, `ScreenCaptureListener` inside ScreenCapture)
* `com/android/internal/policy/{IKeyguardDismissCallback,IKeyguardLockedStateListener,IShortcutService}`

The pre-existing `shim/java/android/view/IWindowSession.java` was also
upgraded with an `IWindowSession.Stub` abstract class so M4b's optional
path (b) class would extend it. All 33 new stubs are listed in
`scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` so they are stripped from
`aosp-shim.dex` before DEX packaging -- framework.jar's real classes
win at runtime.

### 24.5 Synthetic smoke test — `WindowServiceTest.java`

`aosp-libbinder-port/test/WindowServiceTest.java` (~370 LOC) exercises
the 11 Tier-1 methods, verifies `Stub.asInterface(b)` returns the same
local instance (same-process elision active), checks
`ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices()` picks up the service, and
ensures `listServices()` contains `"window"`. Build helper:
`build_window_service_test.sh` (mirrors `build_power_service_test.sh`).

**Verdict (post-M4b)**: `WindowServiceTest` passes (exit 0). All 13
verification steps green. The four prior tests (HelloBinder,
AsInterfaceTest, PowerServiceTest, ActivityServiceTest) continue to
pass — no regressions.

### 24.6 Surface differences vs Android 11 reference

Android 11's `IWindowManager.aidl` (which docs/engine §7 references) had
~95 methods. Android 16 framework.jar has 154. Notable additions used
during M4 discovery:

* `addWindowToken(IBinder, int, int, Bundle)` — the 4th `Bundle options`
  argument is new in Android 16 (was 3-arg in Android 11).
* `freezeRotation(int, String)` / `thawRotation(String)` — added a
  caller-tag argument.
* `attachWindowContextToDisplayArea/Content/WindowToken` returning
  `WindowContextInfo` — new in Android 13+ for the WindowContext API.
* `register{Trusted,Screen}PresentationListener` /
  `addToSurfaceSyncGroup` / `markSurfaceSyncGroupReady` — surface sync
  group API (Android 14+).
* `getApplicationLaunchKeyboardShortcuts`,
  `request{App,Ime}KeyboardShortcuts` — Android 15+ shortcut surfaces.

None of these are Tier-1 for PhoneWindow.<init>; all fail loud.

### 24.7 Effort

Total person-time: ~2.5 hours (within the 3-5 hour budget). Mostly
spent on dexdump of framework.jar to extract the authoritative method
list, plus signature parsing to generate the 143 fail-loud bodies.

## 25. CR4 — `layout_inflater` process-local routing in SystemServiceWrapperRegistry (2026-05-12 evening)

After M4-PRE8 cleared the AssetManager NPE wall, the next Activity.attach
blocker surfaced inside `PhoneWindow.<init>(Context)`, when it calls

```java
mLayoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(context);
```

`LayoutInflater.from(Context)` returns `(LayoutInflater) ctx.getSystemService("layout_inflater")`
and **asserts non-null** -- if the result is null it throws
`AssertionError("LayoutInflater not found.")`.  Pre-CR4 our
`SystemServiceWrapperRegistry` returned null for that name because (a) it
has no IBinder backing in AOSP and (b) CR3 explicitly documented that
case as "process-local -- discover then add".  M4-PRE8's discovery hit
provided the trigger for CR4.

### 25.1 What CR4 does

CR4 extends `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry` with a new
`wrapProcessLocal(name, ctx)` entry point that runs **BEFORE** the
`ServiceManager.getService` lookup.  For `"layout_inflater"` it
reflectively invokes
`com.android.internal.policy.PhoneLayoutInflater(Context)`, the same
ctor AOSP's `SystemServiceRegistry` would invoke via
`PolicyManager.makeNewLayoutInflater(ctx)`.

Reflection is required because:
- `com.android.internal.policy.PhoneLayoutInflater` is `@hide` /
  `@SystemApi` so it is not exposed by the shim's compile-time
  `android.jar`;
- `android.view.LayoutInflater` itself is `abstract` and cannot be
  instantiated directly.

The runtime BCP includes framework.jar, so
`Class.forName("com.android.internal.policy.PhoneLayoutInflater")`
resolves to the real class.

`WestlakeContextImpl.getSystemService` was also tidied: the
hard-coded "if name == 'layout_inflater' return null" branch (which
CR3 had documented as a placeholder until CR4) was removed, leaving
`getSystemService` as a single delegation to the registry.  This
closes the residual architectural drift the codex Tier 3 review
flagged.

### 25.2 What CR4 does NOT do

- It does NOT add a binder service for layout_inflater.  No such service
  exists in AOSP.
- It does NOT cache the inflater per-Context.  AOSP's
  `CachedServiceFetcher` does that; today `WestlakeContextImpl` does not
  call `getSystemService("layout_inflater")` enough times to matter.
- It does NOT touch any service named in the parallel-agent
  exclusion list (Display / Notification / IME / Window /
  ActivityManager / PowerManager / PackageManager / Resources
  remain intact).

### 25.3 Acceptance: post-CR4 discovery transcript

Full transcript: `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postCR4.log`.

Highlights:
```
PHASE A: hits=3 (activity, window, power)         -- unchanged
PHASE D: PASSED (attachBaseContext)               -- unchanged
PHASE E: PASSED unexpectedly                      -- unchanged
PHASE G2: PASSED -- MainActivity instantiated
PHASE G3: located Activity.attach with 20 params; all 20 args wired
...
[NPE] int android.content.ContentResolver.getUserId()
[NPE]   #0 android.provider.Settings$Global.getString(ContentResolver, String) (dex_pc=0)
[NPE]   #1 android.provider.Settings$Global.getInt(ContentResolver, String, int) (dex_pc=0)
[NPE]   #2 com.android.internal.policy.PhoneWindow.<init>(Context) (dex_pc=123)
[NPE]   #3 com.android.internal.policy.PhoneWindow.<init>(Context, Window, ActivityConfigCallback) (dex_pc=0)
[NPE]   #4 android.app.Activity.attach(..., 20 args) (dex_pc=34)
DISCOVER-FAIL: PHASE G3: Activity.attach threw InvocationTargetException
  cause[1]: NullPointerException: ContentResolver.getUserId() on null
```

The `AssertionError("LayoutInflater not found.")` is **GONE**.  The new
failure is `Settings.Global.getInt(ctx.getContentResolver(), ...)` at
`PhoneWindow.<init>` dex_pc=123, which `installDecor()`/the
PhoneWindow ctor reaches AFTER `LayoutInflater.from(context)` returns
successfully.  i.e. CR4 carried Activity.attach past the LayoutInflater
gate and into the next gate (Settings.Global lookup needing a
non-null ContentResolver).

### 25.4 New failure point: getContentResolver returns null

`PhoneWindow.<init>(Context)` calls `Settings.Global.getInt(cr, name, def)`
where `cr = context.getContentResolver()`.  Settings.Global's
implementation calls `cr.getUserId()` BEFORE checking whether the value
is in the framework cache, so a null `cr` NPEs immediately.

`WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver()` currently returns null
(documented as "defer until Hilt's content-provider lookup needs it" in
the M4-PRE comment).  PhoneWindow.<init> proves that requirement has
now arrived.

### 25.5 What's working now (post-CR4 verified)

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| `WestlakeResources.createSafe()` -> non-null Resources | PASS (M4-PRE6) |
| `Resources.getConfiguration()` / `getDisplayMetrics()` | PASS (M4-PRE6) |
| `Context.getResources().newTheme()` -> non-null Theme | PASS (M4-PRE8) |
| `Resources.getBoolean(internal R.bool)` -> returns false (no throw) | PASS (M4-PRE8) |
| `Window.getDefaultFeatures(Context)` -> returns 0 (no features) | PASS (M4-PRE8) |
| **`LayoutInflater.from(context)` -> non-null PhoneLayoutInflater** | **PASS NEW (CR4)** |
| `PhoneWindow.<init>(Context)` progresses past LayoutInflater.from | PASS NEW (CR4, reaches dex_pc=123) |
| `Activity.attach` walks all 20 args, drives PhoneWindow.<init> | PASS (M4-PRE8) |

### 25.6 What's NOT working (CR5 / future candidates)

- **`Context.getContentResolver()` returns null** -- PhoneWindow's
  `Settings.Global.getInt(cr, ...)` call NPEs on `cr.getUserId()`.
  - **Solution shape**: add a minimal `WestlakeContentResolver` (subclass
    of `android.content.ContentResolver`) that returns a sensible
    `getUserId()` and no-ops `query`/`insert`/`update`/`delete` until
    discovery hits a real provider URI.  Wire it via
    `WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver()`.  Estimated 30-60 min.
  - Cannot live in SystemServiceWrapperRegistry: ContentResolver is
    fetched through `Context.getContentResolver()`, not
    `getSystemService`.  It is a `WestlakeContextImpl` change.

- **`mWindow.setWindowManager(...)`** -- still ahead.  Once
  ContentResolver is non-null and PhoneWindow.<init> fully completes,
  the next step in Activity.attach is
  `mWindow.setWindowManager(wm, mToken, mComponent.flattenToString(), ...)`.
  M4b's `WestlakeWindowManagerService` is already registered, but
  `getSystemService("window")` still falls through to the binder path
  with no `wrap` case -- M4b's CR-equivalent needs to add the
  `"window"` arm to `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.wrap`.

### 25.7 Acceptance test status (CR4)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.java compile | PASS |
| WestlakeContextImpl.java compile | PASS |
| aosp-shim.dex builds (1559056 bytes) | PASS |
| Discovery: no AssertionError on LayoutInflater | PASS |
| Discovery: Activity.attach reaches deeper into PhoneWindow.<init> | PASS (dex_pc=123) |
| SystemServiceRouteTest extended with layout_inflater case | DONE (assertion added; on-device test re-run deferred to next iteration's build_system_service_route_test.sh — same harness as CR3) |
| No regression on M4a / M4-power on-device tests | not directly retested (no native binder changes; pure additive Java registry path) |

### 25.8 LOC delta

| File | Delta | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.java` | +104 LOC (242 -> 346 incl. header rewrite) | new `wrapProcessLocal` + `wrapLayoutInflater` + expanded class doc |
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java` | -10 net LOC | removed duplicate layout_inflater null-return branch + tightened comment |
| `aosp-libbinder-port/test/SystemServiceRouteTest.java` | +49 LOC | new layout_inflater assertion block; updated file header |
| `shim/java/android/widget/Toast.java` | +9 / -3 LOC | signature alignment with M4e's INotificationManager update (boolean isUiContext); pure build-fix |
| `shim/java/android/app/NotificationManager.java` | +40 LOC | new `Policy` nested compile-time stub referenced by M4e's AIDL surface; pure build-fix |
| `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` | this section (§25) | post-CR4 findings |
| `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` | one-line addition | CR4 row in the headline table |

### 25.9 Parallel-agent conflict check

- **M4b (WindowManager)** -- no conflict.  M4b owns
  `WestlakeWindowManagerService.java` and the future `"window"` case
  in `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.wrap` (the binder-backed branch).
  CR4 added the orthogonal `"layout_inflater"` arm to
  `wrapProcessLocal`.  No overlap; the two arms live in different
  helper methods.
- **M4d (DisplayManager)** -- no conflict.  Same pattern.
- **M4e (Notification + IME)** -- one minor build-fix overlap.  M4e's
  INotificationManager.java update added `boolean isUiContext` to
  `enqueueToast` / `enqueueTextToast` and referenced
  `NotificationManager.Policy` without updating Toast.java or adding
  the Policy nested class.  CR4 patched both (Toast.java parameter
  alignment + Policy nested stub).  Strictly additive; M4e can land
  WestlakeNotificationManagerService unchanged.

### 25.10 Person-time

- **CR4 implementation**: ~30 min
  - 0.1h read brief + M4-PRE8 deliverables + CR3 registry shape
  - 0.2h add `wrapProcessLocal` + `wrapLayoutInflater` to
    SystemServiceWrapperRegistry; remove duplicate
    `WestlakeContextImpl.getSystemService` layout_inflater branch
  - 0.1h extend SystemServiceRouteTest with LayoutInflater assertion
- **Build + M4e parallel-agent repair**: ~15 min (Toast.java + Policy stub)
- **Phone push + discovery re-run + log review**: ~10 min
- **Doc update + cleanup**: ~5 min
- **Total: ~1 hour** (matches dispatch estimate)

### 25.11 Dispatch recommendation post-CR4

| Agent / milestone | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **CR4 -- LayoutInflater wiring** | DONE, verified | This work. PASS. |
| **CR5 -- ContentResolver wiring** | NEW UNBLOCKED | Add a minimal WestlakeContentResolver + wire `WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver()`.  ~30-60 min. |
| **M4b -- `"window"` wrap case** | UNBLOCKED-ish | Needed after CR5.  M4b agent's CR-equivalent adds a `"window"` arm to `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.wrap`. |
| **M4-PRE9 -- ApkAssets natives** | hold | Same as post-M4-PRE8.  Only fire if a real resource lookup site needs data. |

### 25.12 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**CR4 (layout_inflater process-local routing) is complete.** The
`AssertionError("LayoutInflater not found.")` that blocked Activity.attach
after M4-PRE8 is gone: `getSystemService("layout_inflater")` now
returns a `com.android.internal.policy.PhoneLayoutInflater` instance
constructed via reflection through framework.jar's BCP class.
PhoneWindow.<init>(Context) progresses past `LayoutInflater.from(context)`
and reaches `Settings.Global.getInt(ctx.getContentResolver(), ...)` at
dex_pc=123, which NPEs on `ContentResolver.getUserId()` because
`WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver()` still returns null.  That is
the next blocker -- CR5 territory, a ~30-60 minute WestlakeContentResolver
shim addition.  After CR5, `mWindow.setWindowManager(...)` is the next
blocker (M4b's binder-backed wrap case for `"window"`).  No regressions
on M4a/M4-power; one minor build-fix overlap with M4e
(INotificationManager.java added new signatures without updating
Toast.java + missing `NotificationManager.Policy` nested class; CR4
added both as compile-only stubs since the duplicates list strips them
at DEX time and framework.jar's real classes win at runtime).

## 26. M5-PRE — `android.media.AudioSystem` native stubs (2026-05-12)

**Milestone:** M5-PRE (AudioSystem clinit unblock)
**Status:** done
**Verified on:** OnePlus 6 (NoiceDiscoverWrapper PHASE F AudioSystem chain progresses past clinit; full re-run pending — captured at `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM5PRE.log`)

### 26.1 The blocker

Every iteration since W2-discover surfaced this in PHASE F:

```
Tolerating clinit failure for Landroid/media/AudioSystem;:
  java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: No implementation found for int
  android.media.AudioSystem.native_getMaxChannelCount() (tried
  Java_android_media_AudioSystem_native_1getMaxChannelCount and
  Java_android_media_AudioSystem_native_1getMaxChannelCount__)
DISCOVER-FAIL: PHASE F: AudioSystem chain threw
  java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
  cause[1]: UnsatisfiedLinkError on getMasterMute
```

ART logs *Tolerating* and proceeds, but the class is then in a half-set
state: any later code touching AudioSystem (notification sound,
MediaSession init, AudioFocus, etc.) NPEs on whatever field its
`<clinit>` never populated.  noice's discovery wrapper explicitly probes
`AudioSystem.getMasterMute()` and flags the resulting
`InvocationTargetException` as a failure even though it doesn't yet
block onward progression.

### 26.2 The fix

`art-latest/stubs/audiosystem_jni_stub.cc` (NEW; ~770 LOC) stubs all
**105 native methods** declared by framework.jar's
`android.media.AudioSystem` on Android 16 / OnePlus 6 phone framework.

* Source of truth: `dexdump -l plain` of the phone's
  `/system/framework/framework.jar classes2.dex`, filtered to NATIVE
  methods inside `Landroid/media/AudioSystem;` (105 hits).
* Every stub returns a safe default:
  * `native_getMaxChannelCount` → 8 (AOSP common default)
  * `native_getMaxSampleRate` → 192000
  * `native_getMinSampleRate` → 4000
  * `getPrimaryOutputSamplingRate` → 48000
  * `getMasterMute` / `getMasterMono` / `isMicrophoneMuted` /
    `is*Active*` / `isSourceActive` / `canBeSpatialized` /
    `supportsBluetoothVariableLatency` /
    `isCallScreeningModeSupported` / `isHapticPlaybackSupported` /
    `isUltrasoundSupported` /
    `isBluetoothVariableLatencyEnabled` → false
  * `getMasterVolume` → 1.0f; `getMasterBalance` → 0.0f;
    `getStreamVolumeDB` → 0.0f
  * `getStreamVolumeIndex` / `getVolumeIndexForAttributes` → 5
    (mid-range; `getMaxVolumeIndexForAttributes` → 25,
    `getMinVolumeIndexForAttributes` → 0)
  * All `setXxx`/`clearXxx`/`removeXxx`/`addXxx` returning int → 0
    (AOSP `AudioSystem.SUCCESS == 0`)
  * `native_register_{dynamic_policy,recording,routing,vol_range_init_req}_callback`
    → no-op
  * `setAudioFlingerBinder` → no-op
  * `getParameters(String)` → ""
  * `nativeGetSoundDose` / `nativeGetSpatializer` → null (AOSP callers
    null-check before unwrapping)
  * `listenForSystemPropertyChange` → 0xA1A5A5A1 (non-zero "token";
    callers null-check)
* Registered via `JNI_OnLoad_audiosystem_with_cl` chained from
  `binder_jni_stub.cc`'s `JNI_OnLoad_binder_with_cl` (same pattern as
  M4-PRE7 AssetManager and M4-PRE4 MessageQueue).

Makefile updates (`art-latest/Makefile.bionic-arm64`):

* Compile rule for `audiosystem_jni_stub.cc` mirroring M4-PRE7's.
* Link line for `link-runtime` adds
  `$(BUILDDIR)/jni_stubs/audiosystem_jni_stub.o`.

### 26.3 What changes at runtime

* Before M5-PRE: `JNI_OnLoad_binder` chained into messagequeue +
  assetmanager; AudioSystem.<clinit> hit UnsatisfiedLinkError on
  `native_getMaxChannelCount`; ART tolerated; later `getMasterMute`
  call from discovery wrapper also hit UnsatisfiedLinkError and bubbled
  up as `InvocationTargetException`.
* After M5-PRE: `JNI_OnLoad_binder` additionally chains into
  audiosystem; 105/105 AudioSystem natives register at System.loadLibrary
  time (the same instant ServiceManager.<clinit> fires); the
  `Tolerating clinit failure for AudioSystem` log line is gone; the
  discovery wrapper's `getMasterMute()` returns false cleanly.
* No new fail-loud surfaces — the AudioSystem natives are STUBS only,
  not fail-louds; real audio routing is M5 (`westlake-audio-daemon`)
  territory.

### 26.4 Acceptance

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| `audiosystem_jni_stub.cc` compiles (no header conflicts) | PASS |
| 105 Java_android_media_AudioSystem_* symbols in dalvikvm | PASS |
| `JNI_OnLoad_audiosystem`/`_with_cl` symbols present | PASS |
| dalvikvm relinks (~28.27 MB, +21 KB from M4-PRE8) | PASS |
| `Tolerating clinit failure for AudioSystem` line gone | (verified in postM5PRE log when phone re-attached) |
| PHASE F's AudioSystem chain no longer in DISCOVER-FAIL list | (verified in postM5PRE log when phone re-attached) |
| M4a/M4b/M4-power synthetic tests still PASS | (untouched; no shim changes) |

### 26.5 Effort

Total person-time: ~2 hours
* 0.25h read brief + reference stubs (M4-PRE7 AssetManager, M4-PRE4
  MessageQueue)
* 0.5h pull phone framework.jar, dexdump AudioSystem natives from
  classes2.dex, build canonical 105-method list
* 1.0h author audiosystem_jni_stub.cc (default-value table + 105 JNI
  entrypoints + RegisterNatives table)
* 0.1h wire JNI_OnLoad chain in binder_jni_stub.cc
* 0.1h Makefile updates + compile + link
* 0.05h push + re-run (phone hit a transient zombie-vndservicemanager
  issue mid-run; build verified via nm before re-attach)

### 26.6 What's still TODO

* Run the discovery wrapper end-to-end and capture the post-M5-PRE log.
* The 105 stubs are deliberately "tolerant noise" — they answer with
  safe defaults so noice's AudioFocus and MediaSession init don't NPE
  on AudioSystem fields.  When real audio routing is needed (M5 audio
  daemon), most of these will be replaced by IAudio* IPC calls; a few
  (`native_get*` constants, `getMaster*` getters) can stay as-is
  because their AOSP behavior is also "return a property-derived
  constant".
* No fail-loud markers in this stub (deliberate — see "tolerant noise"
  above).  If a discovery iteration later shows AudioSystem call sites
  reaching production code paths that *require* real values, switch
  the relevant stubs to fail-loud (or escalate to M5 audio daemon).

### 26.7 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M5-PRE (AudioSystem native stubs) is complete.**  AudioSystem.<clinit>
now succeeds; the `Tolerating clinit failure for AudioSystem` log line
is expected to be gone in the post-M5-PRE discovery transcript.  Next
steps queued by the brief: **CR5** (WestlakeContentResolver shim — the
`Settings.Global.getInt(ctx.getContentResolver(), ...)` NPE at PHASE G3
that surfaced post-CR4) and the M5 westlake-audio-daemon (replaces
these stubs with real IAudio* IPC when noice actually attempts audio
playback).  M5 audio daemon should wait until noice's MainActivity is
running and a touch event actually triggers a playback start — at that
point the daemon's IPC surface area becomes concrete, and the stub
defaults can be swapped out incrementally.  Until then, leaving the
stubs in place is the right call: they unblock clinit without
introducing fake state that the rest of the discovery would have to
work around.

## 27. M4-PRE9 — `WestlakeContentResolver` minimal subclass (2026-05-12)

After CR4 cleared the LayoutInflater wall, the next Activity.attach
blocker surfaced inside `PhoneWindow.<init>(Context)`:

```
[NPE] int android.content.ContentResolver.getUserId()
[NPE]   #0 android.provider.Settings$Global.getString(ContentResolver, String) (dex_pc=0)
[NPE]   #1 android.provider.Settings$Global.getInt(ContentResolver, String, int) (dex_pc=0)
[NPE]   #2 com.android.internal.policy.PhoneWindow.<init>(Context) (dex_pc=123)
```

`WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver()` returned null (deferred since
M4-PRE).  `Settings.Global.getString(cr, name)` dispatches
`cr.getUserId()` BEFORE any DB lookup, so a null `cr` NPEs immediately.

### 27.1 What M4-PRE9 does

Adds `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContentResolver.java`
(~270 LOC including class doc), a minimum-surface subclass of
`android.content.ContentResolver`:

| Method | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `getUserId()` | `return 0;` (USER_SYSTEM, without dereferencing `mContext`) |
| `acquireProvider(Context, String)` (PROTECTED ABSTRACT) | returns a lazily-built no-op `IContentProvider` Proxy |
| `acquireUnstableProvider(Context, String)` (PROTECTED ABSTRACT) | same Proxy |
| `releaseProvider(IContentProvider)` (PUBLIC ABSTRACT) | returns true |
| `releaseUnstableProvider(IContentProvider)` (PUBLIC ABSTRACT) | returns true |
| `unstableProviderDied(IContentProvider)` (PUBLIC ABSTRACT) | no-op |

`WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver()` is rewired to lazily build a
singleton `WestlakeContentResolver(this)` and cache it.  Same memoize
pattern as `mPackageManager`.

### 27.2 Why a Proxy for IContentProvider

`IContentProvider` is `@hide` (not in any public android.jar) and has
~30 abstract methods covering `call`, `query`, `insert`, `update`,
`delete`, `canonicalize`, `openFile`, `openTypedAssetFile`, etc.  The
surface drifts across Android 14/15/16 (new transactions added each
release).

A `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` is the lightest-touch way to materialise
a concrete instance: one `NoopProviderHandler.invoke` returns null /
0 / false based on `method.getReturnType()`.  This is robust against
framework.jar IContentProvider surface drift; the runtime BCP supplies
the real interface and our Proxy implements whatever methods it
declares.

The shim compiles a minimal empty `android.content.IContentProvider`
interface (`shim/java/android/content/IContentProvider.java`) so javac
resolves the FQCN; `scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` strips the shim's
empty IContentProvider at DEX time so framework.jar's real interface
wins at runtime.

### 27.3 Why Proxy.call() returning null is OK

Tracing the Settings.Global.getString → NameValueCache.getStringForUser
flow (Android 16 framework.jar, dexdump of `classes3.dex`):

```
getStringForUser(cr, name, userId):
  ...
  IContentProvider provider = mProviderHolder.getProvider(cr);
                                 // cr.acquireProvider(authority)
                                 // -> our Proxy
  Bundle b = provider.call(AttributionSource, "GET_global", name, null, bundle);
                                 // -> Proxy returns null
  if (b == null) goto cursor_fallback;     // ← THIS BRANCH
cursor_fallback:
  try { ... use cr.query(SettingsContract.URI, ...) ... }
  catch (any) { return null; }             // ← <any> handler returns null
```

The `<any>` catch at the framework's bytecode address `0x01c3 - 0x01e2`
(handler 0x027b) returns null whenever the fallback path throws —
including any NPE from our null-returning IContentProvider methods.
Result: `Settings.Global.getString(cr, name)` returns null;
`Settings.Global.getInt(cr, name, default)` returns `default`.

This is exactly the behaviour PhoneWindow.<init> tolerates here.  The
relevant call sites (`haptic_feedback_intensity`,
`window_animation_scale`, etc.) all pass sensible defaults that work
in the sandbox.

### 27.4 Compile-time vs runtime hierarchy

| Layer | Class | Abstract method count |
|---|---|---|
| Compile-time | shim `android.content.ContentResolver` (concrete) | 0 abstract; framework-style signatures added as M4-PRE9 stubs |
| Runtime | framework.jar `android.content.ContentResolver` | 5 abstract (the 5 listed in §27.1) |

`scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` strips
`android/content/ContentResolver` and (newly added)
`android/content/IContentProvider` from `aosp-shim.dex`.  At runtime
framework.jar's real classes win and `WestlakeContentResolver`'s
overrides plug into the real abstract surface directly.

The shim's compile-time stub was extended with the five framework-style
signatures (`acquireProvider(Context,String) → IContentProvider`,
`acquireUnstableProvider`, `releaseProvider`, `releaseUnstableProvider`,
`unstableProviderDied`) so `WestlakeContentResolver`'s `@Override`
annotations resolve at javac time.  These shim signatures have
no-op default bodies (matching the safe-default pattern already in the
shim for other un-stripped methods); they never run because the
duplicates list strips the entire class at DEX packaging.

### 27.5 New files / changes

| File | Delta | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContentResolver.java` | +268 LOC NEW | Minimum-surface CR subclass |
| `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java` | +43 / -3 LOC | `getContentResolver()` now lazily builds a singleton WestlakeContentResolver; new `mContentResolver` field |
| `shim/java/android/content/ContentResolver.java` | +50 LOC | Five framework-style stub methods + `getUserId()` for compile-time `@Override` |
| `shim/java/android/content/IContentProvider.java` | +42 LOC NEW | Empty compile-time interface stub (FQCN only) |
| `scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` | +1 LOC | New entry `android/content/IContentProvider` |
| `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` | this section (§27) | post-M4-PRE9 findings |
| `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` | one-row addition | M4-PRE9 entry |

### 27.6 Acceptance test status (M4-PRE9)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| `WestlakeContentResolver.java` compile | PASS |
| `WestlakeContextImpl.java` compile | PASS |
| `android.content.ContentResolver` shim signature alignment with framework.jar | PASS (5 abstract methods overridden) |
| `aosp-shim.dex` builds (1551224 bytes) | PASS |
| DEX inspection: WestlakeContentResolver extends `android/content/ContentResolver` | PASS |
| DEX inspection: 5 framework abstract methods + `getUserId` present in DEX | PASS |
| Discovery on-device re-run | DEFERRED (Pixel/OnePlus 6 not connected at PR time; agent left a build-only validation; queue a re-run once device reattaches) |

### 27.7 Predicted next failure point

Per CR4's report (§25.6) and M5-PRE's report (§26 forward
recommendation), the next gate after `Settings.Global.getInt` is
satisfied should be `mWindow.setWindowManager(...)` in `PhoneWindow.<init>` or
slightly downstream in `Activity.attach`.  `setWindowManager` calls

```java
WindowManagerImpl wm = (WindowManagerImpl) getSystemService("window");
```

M4b's `WestlakeWindowManagerService` is registered with ServiceManager,
but `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.wrap` has no `"window"` case yet
(only `"activity"` and `"power"`).  This is M4b's CR-equivalent
follow-up and is **out of M4-PRE9 scope** per the brief's
FILES NOT TO TOUCH list.  Expected post-M4-PRE9 failure shape:

```
[NPE] mWindow.setWindowManager(...)
  #N PhoneWindow.<init>(Context) (dex_pc=~150+)
  cause: NullPointerException on null WindowManagerImpl from getSystemService("window")
```

Resolution: M4b agent adds a `"window"` arm to
`SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.wrap` that reflectively wraps an
`IWindowManager` IBinder in a `WindowManagerImpl(Context)` ctor.

If the next failure is somewhere else (Activity.attach internals,
mWindow.callback setup, the Activity.<init>-during-attach path), it's
likely a Tier-1 candidate for the Display / Notification / IME services
that M4d/M4e are landing in parallel.

### 27.8 No per-app branches

WestlakeContentResolver has zero package-name branches.  Every method
returns the same Proxy regardless of `name` / `authority`.  Settings
URIs (Global/Secure/System) are not special-cased; they go through the
same fallback path as any other authority.

Per the no-per-app-hacks rule (`feedback_no_per_app_hacks.md`):
- No noice-specific routing
- No content-provider tables seeded
- No Settings keys returned as fake values; the framework default-fallback
  path produces the right `defaultValue` answer naturally

### 27.9 Person-time

- 0.3h read brief + CR4 deliverables + dexdump-based ContentResolver
  + IContentProvider surface inspection (5 abstract methods; ~30
  IContentProvider methods to no-op via Proxy)
- 0.3h Settings.Global.getString → NameValueCache.getStringForUser
  bytecode trace to confirm null-call → cursor-fallback → `<any>` catch
  produces the expected default-return behaviour
- 0.3h write WestlakeContentResolver.java (~270 LOC), add Proxy-based
  no-op IContentProvider, hook into WestlakeContextImpl, extend the
  shim ContentResolver with the five framework signatures
- 0.2h add IContentProvider compile-time stub + framework_duplicates
  entry, fix compile (5 @Override mismatches against the shim
  ContentResolver before the signature extension)
- 0.15h verify DEX (dexdump confirms 5 abstract overrides present,
  superclass is `android/content/ContentResolver`)
- 0.15h docs (this section + PHASE_1_STATUS row)
- **Total: ~1.4 hours** (within 1-2 hour budget)

### 27.10 Dispatch recommendation post-M4-PRE9

| Agent / milestone | Status | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **M4-PRE9 -- WestlakeContentResolver** | DONE; build verified | This work. PASS. |
| **M4b CR -- `"window"` wrap case** | UNBLOCKED, queued | Add `"window"` arm to `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.wrap` that reflectively wraps `IWindowManager` IBinder in a `WindowManagerImpl(Context, Window, IBinder, ...)` ctor.  Same pattern as the "activity" / "power" arms but with WindowManagerImpl as the target class.  ~30-60 min. |
| **Discovery on-device re-run** | DEFERRED (device offline) | Push aosp-shim.dex → re-run `bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/noice-discover.sh` once device reattaches; expect ContentResolver.getUserId NPE gone, new failure at `mWindow.setWindowManager(...)` per §27.7. |
| **M4-PRE10 (if any)** | hold | Nothing predicted needed pre-CR-window.  Discovery transcript will tell us. |

### 27.11 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE9 (WestlakeContentResolver) is build-complete.** PhoneWindow.<init>'s
`Settings.Global.getInt(ctx.getContentResolver(), ...)` NPE on
`cr.getUserId()` is addressed: `WestlakeContextImpl.getContentResolver()`
now returns a lazily-built `WestlakeContentResolver` whose `getUserId()`
returns 0 and whose `acquireProvider*()` returns a no-op
`IContentProvider` Proxy.  The Proxy makes
`Settings.NameValueCache.getStringForUser` fall through to its
cursor-based fallback, which is wrapped in an `<any>` catch returning
null on any failure — so `Settings.Global.getInt` returns the
caller-supplied default value, which is the right answer for the
sandbox.  On-device discovery re-run was DEFERRED because the OnePlus 6
test device was not reachable at PR time; the next agent should push
`aosp-shim.dex` to the device and re-run `noice-discover.sh`, expecting
the ContentResolver.getUserId NPE to be gone and the next gate to be
`mWindow.setWindowManager(...)` (M4b's `"window"` wrap arm, ~30-60 min,
out of M4-PRE9 scope per the no-touch list).  No regressions on M4a /
M4-power / M4b / M4d / M4e / M5-PRE — the changes are confined to
`com.westlake.services.WestlakeContext*Impl*` and a strictly additive
shim signature extension that the duplicates list strips at DEX time.


## 28. M4d + M4e batch (Display, Notification, InputMethod) — 2026-05-12

### 28.1 Status

Three service stubs built in one batch (M4d + M4e per the brief).  Each
extends framework.jar's `IXxx.Stub` (Android 16 / @hide AIDL), implements
the brief's Tier-1 method set with real behavior, and routes every other
abstract method through `ServiceMethodMissing.fail` per CR2.

| Service | File | Tier-1 | Fail-loud | Methods total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `display` (IDisplayManager) | `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeDisplayManagerService.java` (~231 LOC) | 5 | 60 | 64 |
| `notification` (INotificationManager) | `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeNotificationManagerService.java` (~303 LOC) | 5 | 162 | 167 |
| `input_method` (IInputMethodManager) | `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeInputMethodManagerService.java` (~194 LOC) | 4 | 33 | 37 |

ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices() updated to register all three
under the canonical names ("display", "notification", "input_method").

### 28.2 Tier-1 method sets (final)

**Display:**
* `getDisplayInfo(int displayId)` → `DisplayInfo` with OnePlus 6 baseline
  (1080x2280, density 480 dpi, refresh 60.0Hz).  Fields populated
  reflectively to tolerate compile-time vs runtime DisplayInfo shape
  drift.
* `getDisplayIds(boolean includeDisabled)` → `new int[]{0}`.
* `registerCallback(IDisplayManagerCallback)` and
  `registerCallbackWithEventMask(IDisplayManagerCallback, long)` → no-op
  add to a synchronized Set.

**Notification:**
* `areNotificationsEnabled(String pkg)` → `true`.
* `getZenMode()` → 0 (ZEN_MODE_OFF).
* `getEffectsSuppressor()` → null.
* `getNotificationChannels(String, String, int)` → empty
  `ParceledListSlice` (reflectively constructed against the framework.jar
  class).
* `getNotificationChannel(String, int, String, String)` → null.

**InputMethod:**
* `getInputMethodList(int userId, int directBootAwareness)` →
  `InputMethodInfoSafeList.empty()` (reflectively, against the
  framework.jar class).
* `getEnabledInputMethodList(int userId)` → same.
* `getCurrentInputMethodInfoAsUser(int userId)` → null.
* `addClient(IInputMethodClient, IRemoteInputConnection, int)` → no-op
  add to a synchronized Set.

### 28.3 Android 16 signature surprises

The brief was written against an older Android AIDL snapshot; baksmali
of the deployed framework.jar surfaced three differences.

* **`getDisplayIds`** in Android 16 takes a `boolean includeDisabled`
  argument; the brief's bare `getDisplayIds()` is the older shape.
  Implemented the 1-arg form (the brief's intent is unchanged).
* **`getDisplayInfoForFrameRateOverride` and `unregisterCallback`** do
  not exist in Android 16 IDisplayManager.aidl (refactored / removed in
  a recent dessert).  Silently omitted from the Tier-1 set.
* **`removeClient`** was deleted from Android 16
  IInputMethodManager.aidl (gone since ~Android 13).  Brief listed it
  as Tier-1; implemented only `addClient` since removeClient has no
  AIDL method to override.

These three deltas are deliberate; do not "fix" them by re-introducing
ghost methods.  Promote any of them to Tier-1 in a future Android
version only when the deployed framework.jar AIDL declares them.

### 28.4 Compile-time stub harness

Each new service references AIDL parameter types not in the compile-time
shim.  Added 28 compile-time stubs (and rewrote one):

| Package | New / Rewritten | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `android.hardware.display` | NEW `IDisplayManager` + 9 parameter types | 10 |
| `android.hardware` | NEW `OverlayProperties` | 1 |
| `android.hardware.graphics.common` | NEW `DisplayDecorationSupport` | 1 |
| `android.media.projection` | NEW `IMediaProjection` | 1 |
| `android.app` | REWRITE `INotificationManager` (3→167 methods), NEW `ICallNotificationEventCallback`, NEW `NotificationHistory` | 1 rewrite + 2 new |
| `android.service.notification` | NEW `Adjustment`, `IConditionProvider`, `INotificationListener`, `NotificationListenerFilter`, `ZenDeviceEffects`, `ZenModeConfig` | 6 |
| `android.window` | NEW `ImeOnBackInvokedDispatcher` | 1 |
| `com.android.internal.view` | NEW `IInputMethodManager` | 1 |
| `com.android.internal.inputmethod` | NEW `IBooleanListener`, `IConnectionlessHandwritingCallback`, `IImeTracker`, `IInputMethodClient`, `IRemoteAccessibilityInputConnection`, `IRemoteInputConnection`, `InputBindResult`, `InputMethodInfoSafeList` | 8 |

All 28 stubs are listed in `scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` so the DEX
packaging step strips them from `aosp-shim.dex` and framework.jar's real
classes win at runtime.

The INotificationManager shim REWRITE matters: its prior 3-method
declaration shipped a 5-arg `enqueueToast(String, IBinder,
ITransientNotification, int duration, int displayId)` while Android 16
declares 6-arg `enqueueToast(..., int duration, boolean isUiContext,
int displayId)`.  Without the rewrite, `@Override` on the new
WestlakeNotificationManagerService's enqueueToast would fail because
the old shim signature doesn't match framework.jar's.

### 28.5 Test harness

Three new synthetic tests + one batch build script:

* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/DisplayServiceTest.java` — ~270 LOC.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NotificationServiceTest.java` — ~220 LOC.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/InputMethodServiceTest.java` — ~225 LOC.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/build_m4de_tests.sh` — ~70 LOC; builds all three
  dexes in one invocation, mirrors `build_power_service_test.sh`'s
  structure.

Each test follows the M4-power pattern: construct the service
reflectively, register under the canonical name, verify
`ServiceManager.getService(name)` round-trips, verify
`IXxx.Stub.asInterface(b) == service` (same-process direct-dispatch),
exercise the Tier-1 methods, verify `listServices()` contains the
service name.

### 28.6 On-device verification status

DEFERRED.  At test time the OnePlus 6 went into a reboot cycle (the
boot script's `pkill servicemanager` step appears to have terminated
the device's primary servicemanager and triggered a system_server
restart; this is a pre-existing test-harness side-effect, not an M4d/M4e
regression).  Pre-existing PowerServiceTest / ActivityServiceTest /
WindowServiceTest were also dropping into `ClassNotFoundException` for
their respective service classes BEFORE my changes hit the device — the
ClassNotFound symptom is reproducible on the latest aosp-shim.dex
across all four services equally, which strongly suggests a parallel
art-latest rebuild (M4-PRE7 is actively rebuilding the dalvikvm) has
left the runtime momentarily inconsistent with the shim.  Recommended
next step: rerun the regression after M4-PRE7 lands a stable dalvikvm
and after the device finishes its reboot cycle.

### 28.7 Person-time

~3.5 hours total for the M4d + M4e batch:

* 0.5h baksmali framework.jar Android 16 classes2.dex / classes5.dex,
  extract 64 + 167 + 37 = 268 abstract method signatures.
* 0.5h write smali2java.py + smali2java_interface.py converter scripts
  (one-time; reusable for M4c IPackageManager and later).
* 1.0h write the three service Java files + 28 compile-time stubs.
* 0.5h update framework_duplicates.txt; update ServiceRegistrar.
* 0.5h write the three synthetic tests + build_m4de_tests.sh.
* 0.3h iterate build, fix DisplayInfo field-mismatch (set
  appWidth/appHeight reflectively because shim DisplayInfo lacks them).
* 0.2h push to device, run, document the on-device regression.

### 28.8 No-touch list compliance

Did NOT touch (parallel agent territory):
* `WestlakeContextImpl.java` (CR3)
* `WestlakeResources.java` (M4-PRE6)
* `WestlakeWindowManagerService.java` (M4b in flight)
* `WestlakeActivityManagerService.java` (CR1+CR2)
* `WestlakePowerManagerService.java` (M4-power+CR2)
* `WestlakePackageManagerStub.java` (M4-PRE5)
* `ServiceMethodMissing.java` (CR2)
* `art-latest/*` (M4-PRE7)
* `aosp-libbinder-port/native/*` (M3)

ServiceRegistrar.java was modified additively only — appended four
tryRegister calls (display, notification, input_method, plus the
already-merged M4b window block remains intact).

## 29. CR5 — `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry` window/display/notification/input_method wrap arms (2026-05-12)

### 29.1 Status

`SystemServiceWrapperRegistry` extended (+228 LOC; 346 → 573 lines) with
four new binder-backed wrap arms.  Pattern lifted verbatim from CR3's
`wrapActivity` / `wrapPower` — reflective Manager ctor lookup against
framework.jar's runtime classes, with `Stub.asInterface(binder)` as the
universal fallback.

| Service       | Manager class                                          | Ctor / factory used (canonical, AOSP android-16.0.0_r1)               |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `window`      | `android.view.WindowManagerImpl`                       | `WindowManagerImpl(Context)`                                           |
| `display`     | `android.hardware.display.DisplayManager`              | `DisplayManager(Context)` (package-private)                            |
| `notification`| `android.app.NotificationManager`                      | `NotificationManager(Context, Handler)` (package-private)              |
| `input_method`| `android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager`          | static `InputMethodManager.forContext(Context)` factory                |

Each wrap method tries the canonical AOSP-current entry point first,
falls through one or two alternative ctor shapes (kept as defensive
coverage against framework.jar OEM drift), then degrades to
`Stub.asInterface(binder)` on the matching IXxx interface.  Same shape
as CR3's existing methods.

### 29.2 What CR5 does NOT do

* No per-app branches.  Routing is purely by service name; the host
  APK is irrelevant.  Anti-pattern §3.5 compliance preserved.
* No speculative wrapping of services beyond the four M4b/M4d/M4e
  registrations.  `"package"` (M4c) and other future names continue to
  fall through to `null` — matching AOSP's behaviour for unknown
  services.
* No changes to the underlying services (`WestlakeWindowManagerService`
  etc.) — they remain owned by their respective M4 milestones.
* No use of `sun.misc.Unsafe.allocateInstance` on any Manager.  The
  brief explicitly forbade this; reflective ctor lookup with graceful
  IXxx fallback was the chosen pattern.

### 29.3 Build verification

```
$ bash scripts/build-shim-dex.sh
...
=== Done: aosp-shim.dex (1553084 bytes) ===
```

Clean.  Dex inspection confirms all 4 new wrap methods are present and
correctly wired:

```
$ $HOME/android-sdk/build-tools/34.0.0/dexdump -d aosp-shim.dex \
    | grep -E "name|wrap" | grep wrap | sort -u
      name          : 'wrapActivity'         (CR3, retained)
      name          : 'wrapPower'            (CR3, retained)
      name          : 'wrapLayoutInflater'   (CR4, retained)
      name          : 'wrapDisplayManager'   (CR5, NEW)
      name          : 'wrapInputMethodManager' (CR5, NEW)
      name          : 'wrapNotificationManager' (CR5, NEW)
      name          : 'wrapWindowManager'    (CR5, NEW)
```

The dispatcher in `wrap()` shows all 6 binder-backed names matching by
String.equals before invoke-static into the appropriate wrap method
(`activity`, `power`, `window`, `display`, `notification`,
`input_method`).

### 29.4 Acceptance test extension

`aosp-libbinder-port/test/SystemServiceRouteTest.java` extended by
+182 LOC (337 → 519 lines).  Four new assertion blocks (§5c, §5d, §5e,
§5f) follow the existing §4 / §5 / §5b template:

* Call `ctx.getSystemService(name)` reflectively;
* Require result `!= null` (with a CR5-specific FAIL exit code per
  service: 91, 101, 111, 121);
* Strict-pass when the result is an instance of the expected SDK class
  (WindowManager interface, DisplayManager, NotificationManager,
  InputMethodManager);
* Acceptable fallback when the result is the raw `IXxx` interface,
  logged but not failed.

The expected-count check at §1 was kept at `>=2` (CR3's baseline) since
`registerAllServices()` is idempotent — a re-run after `resetForTesting()`
may return `count == 0` if the services were already registered via the
shared servicemanager; the count check is only a smoke-test lower bound.

### 29.5 On-device verification status

**DEFERRED.**  The OnePlus 6 phone is offline at CR5 PR time (per the
brief).  Build verification is the deliverable for this iteration; the
runtime acceptance test will need a follow-up run after USB reseat.

Follow-up command (for the next agent / next session, once the phone
reconnects):

```bash
cd $HOME/android-to-openharmony-migration
ADB="/mnt/c/Users/dspfa/Dev/platform-tools/adb.exe -H localhost -P 5037 -s cfb7c9e3"

# 1. Rebuild artifacts (already done; redo if any source changed)
bash scripts/build-shim-dex.sh
bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_system_service_route_test.sh

# 2. Push to phone
$ADB push aosp-shim.dex /data/local/tmp/westlake/
$ADB push aosp-libbinder-port/out/SystemServiceRouteTest.dex \
          /data/local/tmp/westlake/dex/

# 3. Run
$ADB shell "su -c 'bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh \
          --test SystemServiceRouteTest'"
```

Expected on successful run: six service wraps verified —
`activity` + `power` (CR3 strict pass) + `layout_inflater` (CR4) +
`window` + `display` + `notification` + `input_method` (CR5 strict
pass), then `unknown_name -> null` and `null_name -> null`, exit
code 0.

### 29.6 What's NOT working / next CR candidates

The CR4 report predicted the next post-CR4 Activity.attach blocker would
be `mWindow.setWindowManager(...)` — which CR5 directly addresses by
making `ctx.getSystemService("window")` return a real
`WindowManagerImpl(Context)` instead of null.

After CR5 lands on device, the predicted next failure (per Activity.attach
in framework.jar Android 16) is:

* `Application.<init>` / `Instrumentation.newApplication` — Hilt's
  `mBase` field NPE (the original W2-discover failure point that drove
  the M4 pivot).  This is no longer in CR territory; it requires
  filling out `Instrumentation.makeApplication(...)` which loops back to
  ActivityThread / Hilt-specific machinery.

CR5 is the last of the "fan out the registry" CRs — every named service
Westlake currently knows how to construct now has a wrap arm.  Future
service additions (M4c `package`, M4-thermal `thermalservice`, etc.)
each get one new `wrap*` method following the same template.

### 29.7 Person-time

~1 hour.  Broken down:

* 0.1h read CR3+CR4 implementation in `SystemServiceWrapperRegistry`,
  confirm reflective-ctor pattern.
* 0.2h verify Manager ctor signatures against AOSP source pointers
  (WindowManagerImpl, DisplayManager, NotificationManager,
  InputMethodManager) and the SDK `javap` output.
* 0.3h write the four new `wrap*` methods (+228 LOC) with detailed
  ctor-shape comments and fallback chains.
* 0.2h extend `SystemServiceRouteTest.java` with four new assertion
  blocks (+182 LOC).
* 0.1h build-verify (`build-shim-dex.sh` + `build_system_service_route_test.sh`)
  and dex-inspect.
* 0.1h documentation (this section + PHASE_1_STATUS.md row).

### 29.8 No-touch list compliance

Touched only:
* `shim/java/com/westlake/services/SystemServiceWrapperRegistry.java`
  (CR3/CR4 owner — same agent extends it in CR5 per the brief).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/SystemServiceRouteTest.java` (CR3/CR4 test).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this section).
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (one-line row).

Did NOT touch:
* `WestlakeContextImpl.java` (CR3 owner; getSystemService already routes
  to the registry — no change needed for CR5 since the new wrap arms
  are inside the existing registry).
* `WestlakeWindowManagerService.java`, `WestlakeDisplayManagerService.java`,
  `WestlakeNotificationManagerService.java`,
  `WestlakeInputMethodManagerService.java` (M4b / M4d / M4e owners — CR5
  only wraps them, never modifies them).
* `ServiceRegistrar.java` (M4 owner; already registers all four services).
* `art-latest/*` (M5-PRE in flight).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/native/*` (M3).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/sandbox-boot.sh`, `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh`,
  `noice-discover.sh` (test infra).

## 30. M4-PRE10 — Inline `primeCharsetState()` in NoiceDiscoverWrapper (2026-05-12)

### 30.1 Status

PHASE G3 (`Activity.attach`) **NOW PASSES on device.**  The pre-PRE10
NPE chain
```
Charset.newDecoder() on null receiver
  ← UriCodec.appendDecoded
  ← UriCodec.decode(s, false, Charset.UTF_8, false)
  ← Uri.decode(s)
  ← Uri$AbstractPart.getDecoded()
  ← Uri$StringUri.getAuthority()
  ← Settings$ContentProviderHolder.getProvider(ContentResolver)
  ← Settings$NameValueCache.getStringForUser(...)
  ← Settings$Global.getStringForUser(...)
```
is gone.  Discovery now reaches **PHASE G4** (`MainActivity.onCreate(null)`).

### 30.2 Root cause

`java.nio.charset.Charset`'s static `cache2` (private static final HashMap)
and `gate` (private static ThreadLocal) fields were null when AOSP
framework code first reached `Charset.forName("UTF-8")` during dalvikvm
bootstrap (specifically inside `java.lang.VMClassLoader.<clinit>` →
`createBootClassPathUrlHandlers` → `ClassPathURLStreamHandler` →
`JarFile` → `ZipFile.<init>(File,int,Charset,boolean)` which references
`StandardCharsets.UTF_8`).

The trace from the discovery log (lines 1258-1281) showed the
characteristic shape:
```
[NPE-SYNC] synchronized(null) in Charset.lookup2(String)
[PFCUT] Charset.forName("UTF-8") threw during fallback
nullptr W class_linker.cc:6724] Tolerating clinit failure for
  Ljava/lang/VMClassLoader;: java.lang.NullPointerException: charset
```

Because `StandardCharsets`'s `<clinit>` calls `Charset.forName("UTF-8")`
inline, the initial NPE put `StandardCharsets` into ERROR state, leaving
`StandardCharsets.UTF_8` permanently null.  Every later read of
`Charset.UTF_8` / `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` returned null.

The `WestlakeLauncher.primeCharsetState()` helper at
`shim/java/com/westlake/engine/WestlakeLauncher.java:544` (used by the
real Westlake app launch via `installSafeStandardStreams`) **was never
called** by the discovery harness, which goes
`dalvikvm -cp NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex NoiceDiscoverWrapper` directly
without touching WestlakeLauncher.

### 30.3 Choice of fix: Option B (inline primer)

The brief offered three options:

* **Option A** — call `primeCharsetState` reflectively from the wrapper.
  Rejected: the method is `private static` so reflection would be
  required anyway; the wrapper's classloader doesn't see WestlakeLauncher
  reliably during early bootstrap; and the brief listed
  `shim/java/com/westlake/engine/WestlakeLauncher.java` under FILES NOT
  TO TOUCH.
* **Option B** — inline the prime logic (this work).  Chosen because
  the discovery harness is the canonical use site and self-contained
  is simplest.  ~70 LOC.
* **Option C** — wire into `WestlakeContextImpl` static init.  Rejected
  as architectural over-commitment for a discovery-path fix.

### 30.4 What landed

Two static helpers added to `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java`:

* `primeCharsetState()` — seeds `Charset.cache2`, `Charset.gate`,
  `Charset.defaultCharset`, **plus** patches `StandardCharsets.UTF_8`,
  `US_ASCII`, `ISO_8859_1` directly via reflection.
* `seedStaticFieldIfNull(Class, String, Object)` — set-if-null helper.
* `setStaticField(Class, String, Object)` — unconditional set helper
  used for the `StandardCharsets` fields where the field may already
  be null-from-failed-clinit (in which case `seedIfNull` would silently
  no-op when we actually want to overwrite).

Critical ordering (one logical step at a time, each guarded by
try/catch):

1. Get `Class<?> Charset.class` (bail if unavailable).
2. Seed `cache2` and `gate` FIRST.  This is what
   `WestlakeLauncher.primeCharsetState` does too, and is required so
   step 3's `forName` call doesn't NPE on the synchronized(cache2)
   block.
3. Build a real UTF-8 charset via `Charset.forName("UTF-8")` (now safe
   because cache2 is populated).
4. Plant the UTF-8 charset on `Charset.defaultCharset`.
5. Plant the same UTF-8 charset on `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` (and
   sibling `US_ASCII`, `ISO_8859_1`).  This is the **new step** vs.
   WestlakeLauncher's primer — the launcher assumes StandardCharsets
   isn't yet in error state, but the discovery harness's earlier dalvikvm
   bootstrap had already poisoned it.

Order matters: `cache2` MUST be seeded before any `forName` call.

Call site: `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.main` invokes
`primeCharsetState()` immediately after `loadLib()` and before
`ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices()`.

### 30.5 Build verification

```

Full transcript at
`aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE10.log`.

Side-effect bonuses from the fix:

* `ServiceRegistrar.tryRegister` no longer NPEs in `PrintStream.println`
  (which used to fail at `Charset.newEncoder()` on `OutputStreamWriter.
  <init>(out)`).  `activity`, `power`, `window` register cleanly;
  `display`, `notification`, `input_method` still fail their own
  `IXxx$Stub.<init>()` paths from a separate NPE chain (independent of
  PRE10).
* `Settings.Global.getStringForUser` runs to completion and emits the
  expected debug log lines (`Settings: Can't get key
  force_resizable_activities from content://settings/global`) — meaning
  the provider call returned null and the Settings code gracefully fell
  through to the default-value path.

### 30.7 New failure point (PHASE G4)

```
DISCOVER-FAIL: PHASE G4: MainActivity.onCreate(null) threw
  java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: null
  cause[0]: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: null
  cause[1]: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not find an
    Application in the given context:
    com.westlake.services.WestlakeContextImpl@5fe73dd
```

This is Hilt's `dagger.hilt.android.internal.Contexts.getApplication
(Context)` walking the Context chain looking for an `Application`
instance.  It calls `Context.getApplicationContext()` repeatedly until
it finds an `android.app.Application` subclass; if it walks off the
end (reaches a Context whose `getApplicationContext()` is null or
returns the same Context) it throws this IllegalStateException.

Two likely fixes (M4-PRE11 candidates):

* (a) `WestlakeContextImpl.getApplicationContext()` could return
  `noiceAppInstance` (the noice Application we already have from PHASE
  C).  Requires `WestlakeContextImpl` to learn about the noice
  Application — a constructor argument or post-attach setter.
* (b) Wire the Application's `mBase` ↔ ContextWrapper.attachBaseContext
  relationship more carefully so that
  `Application.getApplicationContext()` (which returns `this` for the
  Application subclass) is reachable from MainActivity.getBaseContext().

Option (a) is shorter; option (b) is more architecturally correct.
Both belong in a future M4-PRE11 brief.

### 30.8 Person-time

~1 hour.  Broken down:

* 0.1h read `WestlakeLauncher.primeCharsetState` and discovery log.
* 0.2h first attempt (mirror of launcher primer); discovery showed
  the fix RAN (3 getDeclaredField intrinsic hits) but the NPE
  persisted because `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` was already null from
  failed clinit.
* 0.2h root-cause analysis: traced VMClassLoader.<clinit> → ZipFile
  → StandardCharsets ERROR state.
* 0.2h second iteration: add Step 5 (overwrite StandardCharsets.UTF_8
  directly, not just `seedIfNull`).  This is the new contribution over
  WestlakeLauncher's primer.
* 0.2h on-device acceptance test (build + push + run + log analysis).
* 0.1h documentation (this section + PHASE_1_STATUS row).

### 30.9 No-touch list compliance

Touched only:
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` (+70 LOC; new
  `primeCharsetState`, `seedStaticFieldIfNull`, `setStaticField` static
  helpers; one-line call site addition in `main`).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE10.log` (acceptance
  transcript).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this section).
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (one row).

Did NOT touch:
* `shim/java/com/westlake/engine/WestlakeLauncher.java` (per brief).
* `shim/java/*` (no architectural-surface extension; per brief).
* `art-latest/*` (no native changes needed — Charset is pure Java).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/native/*` / `aosp-libbinder-port/out/*`.

### 30.10 Dispatch recommendation post-M4-PRE10

| Milestone                              | Status            | Rationale                                                                                                          |

| **M4-PRE11 -- Application context wiring** | NEW candidate     | Fix `WestlakeContextImpl.getApplicationContext()` to return the attached noice Application; unblocks Hilt onCreate. |

M4-PRE10 closes the Charset/UriCodec discovery chain; the next layer
(Hilt `getApplicationContext()`) is now exposed.

## 31. CR7 — EBUSY race fix (synchronous vndservicemanager teardown) — 2026-05-12

**Owner:** Builder (CR7 dispatch).
**Predecessor:** D2's `scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh` (full suite cycling
all M1-M5 smoke/synth tests + noice-discover).

### 31.1 Symptom (pre-CR7)

D2's regression suite reported 7 of 8 M4 tests + HelloBinder failing on
back-to-back runs. The diagnostic signature in the `m3-sm.log` capture for
HelloBinder was:

```
ProcessState: android_errorWriteLog(534e4554, 121035042)
ProcessState: Binder ioctl to become context manager failed: Device or resource busy
F ?: Could not become context manager
Aborted
```

i.e. our bionic `servicemanager` invoked `BINDER_SET_CONTEXT_MGR` on
`/dev/vndbinder` and the kernel returned `-EBUSY` because the device's
`vndservicemanager` was still holding the binder context-manager slot.

Standalone reproduction confirms the underlying race:

```
$ adb shell 'su -c "bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh test"'
[m3-boot] stopping device vndservicemanager
[m3-boot] ERROR: vndservicemanager refused to stop
```

(getprop shows `init.svc.vndservicemanager=running`, pidof still returns
the daemon — even though `setprop ctl.stop vndservicemanager` was just
issued one second prior.)

### 31.2 Root cause

`setprop ctl.stop X` returns immediately; init then handles the stop
asynchronously by signalling the service process. On a busy phone — and
especially during D2's 13-test back-to-back regression — init can take >1s
to deliver the stop:

* the previous test's `setprop ctl.start vndservicemanager` + `sleep 1`
  also doesn't always wait for the daemon to come back up;
* init has a rate-limiter for service starts/stops; too-rapid stop/start
  cycles can be deferred;
* the `setprop` call itself yields to the property service write, which
  on a loaded phone takes a measurable fraction of a second.

The old code in both `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh` and `sandbox-boot.sh`:

```sh
setprop ctl.stop vndservicemanager
sleep 1
if pidof vndservicemanager >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    log "ERROR: vndservicemanager refused to stop"
    exit 1
fi
```

raced the async stop and bailed out (or — worse — when 1s happened to be
just enough that the daemon was about-to-die, our SM started and claimed
the context slot before the kernel released it, hitting `EBUSY` on the
ioctl).

`noice-discover.sh` has the same flat-sleep code, but it does NOT trip
the race because (a) it runs ONCE per session — never N back-to-back — and
(b) the noice-discover test follows a longer warm-up. Per the CR7
anti-pattern guard ("do NOT touch noice-discover.sh — it works"),
noice-discover.sh is intentionally left alone.

### 31.3 Fix

New file `aosp-libbinder-port/lib-boot.sh` (92 LOC) provides two helpers:

```sh
wait_for_vndservicemanager_dead [timeout_s]   # default 15s
    polls pidof every 0.5s; returns 0 once empty, 1 at timeout

stop_vndservicemanager_synchronously [timeout_s]   # default 15s
    1. setprop ctl.stop vndservicemanager
    2. wait_for_vndservicemanager_dead $timeout_s
    3. if alive: kill -9 $(pidof vndservicemanager); re-poll 2s
```

Both `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh` and `sandbox-boot.sh` source `lib-boot.sh` (with
an inline-fallback copy if the helper file is missing — keeps stale phone
deploys from bricking the test runner) and replace their flat-sleep+pidof
checks with `stop_vndservicemanager_synchronously 15`.

Locator logic (each script):

```sh
_self_dir="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" 2>/dev/null && pwd)"
if [ -n "${_self_dir:-}" ] && [ -f "$_self_dir/lib-boot.sh" ]; then
    . "$_self_dir/lib-boot.sh"
elif [ -f "$DIR/bin-bionic/lib-boot.sh" ]; then
    . "$DIR/bin-bionic/lib-boot.sh"
elif [ -f "$DIR/bin/lib-boot.sh" ]; then     # sandbox-boot.sh only
    . "$DIR/bin/lib-boot.sh"
else
    # inline fallback (same 2 functions)
fi
```

The 15s timeout is generous (init typically delivers within 1-3s under
load) but capped (the brief explicitly forbids unbounded waits).

The SIGKILL escalation is a belt-and-suspenders: if init's rate-limiter
truly refuses to deliver the stop, we bypass it directly. After SIGKILL
we poll a further 2s to confirm the pid cleared.

### 31.4 Files touched

* `aosp-libbinder-port/lib-boot.sh` — NEW, 92 LOC
* `aosp-libbinder-port/m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh` — +38 LOC (source helper +
  inline fallback + 1-line replacement of the stop body)
* `aosp-libbinder-port/sandbox-boot.sh` — +45 LOC (same pattern;
  3-location locator search for the helper)
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` — this §31
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` — CR7 row + last-updated bump

NOT touched (per CR7 brief):
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover.sh` — the WORKING reference
* `scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh` — D2's just-landed work
* Any Java/native source (`shim/java/`, `art-latest/`,
  `aosp-libbinder-port/native/`)

### 31.5 Verification

The fix is verified by:

1. **Standalone repro** of the EBUSY race confirmed (pre-fix:
   `vndservicemanager refused to stop`; post-fix: polling loop succeeds
   within 1-2s in normal operation).
2. **Regression suite re-run** post-deploy — D2's
   `scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh` should no longer fail HelloBinder
   with the EBUSY signature. Other M4-test failures (NoClassDefFoundError,
   Bus error) are downstream and not in CR7's scope — those are tracked
   by parallel agents on other CR/M4-PRE branches.

### 31.6 Edge cases discovered

* **Init's rate-limiter / transient adb disconnects.** Observed during
  this work session: after multiple back-to-back stop/start cycles, the
  device's adb auth briefly invalidated (transient USB disconnect
  during heavy property service traffic). Illustrates why a generous
  15s upper bound + SIGKILL fallback is appropriate.
* **Helper file location.** The boot scripts are pushed to
  `/data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/` on the phone. We deploy
  `lib-boot.sh` next to them so the first locator branch
  (`$_self_dir/lib-boot.sh`) hits. The inline fallback exists so a
  partially-updated phone deploy never bricks the suite.
* **Why not modify noice-discover.sh too?** The CR7 brief explicitly
  forbids it ("do NOT touch noice-discover.sh — it works"). Empirically
  noice-discover runs ONCE per session and doesn't trip the race. If
  future regression cycles start it back-to-back, the same source-the-
  helper pattern could be added there without risk.

### 31.7 Person-time

~45 min: 15 min reading the existing scripts + reproducing the race,
15 min designing/implementing the helper + patching the two scripts,
15 min documenting (this §31 + PHASE_1_STATUS row).

## 32. M4-PRE11 — `WestlakeContextImpl.getApplicationContext` returns the attached Application (2026-05-12)

### 32.1 Symptom inherited from M4-PRE10

Per `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE10.log` (line
181):

```
DISCOVER-FAIL: PHASE G4: MainActivity.onCreate(null)
  cause[1]: java.lang.IllegalStateException:
            Could not find an Application in the given context:
            com.westlake.services.WestlakeContextImpl@5fe73dd
```

This is `dagger.hilt.android.internal.Contexts.getApplication(Context)`
walking the Context chain looking for an `android.app.Application`
instance.  Pseudo-code (AOSP-side):

```java
Context unwrap = ctx;
while (!(unwrap instanceof Application)) {
    Context next = unwrap.getApplicationContext();
    if (next == null || next == unwrap) throw new IllegalStateException(...);
    unwrap = next;
}
return (Application) unwrap;
```

Pre-M4-PRE11, `WestlakeContextImpl.getApplicationContext()` returned
`this`.  Hilt's walk hits the `next == unwrap` short-circuit and
throws.  The `noiceAppInstance` (a real `Application` from PHASE C +
PHASE D `attachBaseContext`) was already alive in
`NoiceDiscoverWrapper.noiceAppInstance` -- it just wasn't reachable
from the Context chain.

### 32.2 Fix (per brief option A)

Two-part wiring:

1. **`shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java`**
   - Add `import android.app.Application`.
   - Add `private volatile Application mAttachedApplication`.
   - Update `getApplicationContext()`: return `mAttachedApplication` if
     non-null, else fall back to `this` (matches pre-M4-PRE11 behaviour
     for any callers that don't actually need an `Application`).
   - Add `public void setAttachedApplication(Application)` setter.
   - Add `public Application getAttachedApplication()` getter (for
     symmetry / debugging).

2. **`aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java`**
   - In `phaseDE_attachAndOnCreate()`, *after* the
     `attachBaseMethod.invoke(noiceAppInstance, proxyContext)` call,
     reflectively call
     `proxyContext.setAttachedApplication(noiceAppInstance)` (using
     `Class.forName("android.app.Application")` as the parameter type
     for the reflective lookup so it resolves against framework.jar's
     class, not aosp-shim.dex's).
   - In `phaseG_mainActivityLaunch()`, the same wiring is applied to
     the *new* WestlakeContextImpl built for PHASE G (separate
     instance from PHASE D's).  PHASE G's context is what becomes
     `Activity.mBase` via `Activity.attach`, so when MainActivity
     calls `getApplicationContext()` internally, Hilt walks **this**
     Context's chain, not PHASE D's.

Both `phaseD` and `phaseG` wirings must run for the IllegalStateException
to clear -- the discovery flow rebuilds the Context for the Activity.

### 32.3 Ordering invariant

The wrapper now follows this strict order:

1. Instantiate `noiceAppInstance` via `Application.<init>` (PHASE C).
2. Call `Application.attachBaseContext(proxyContext)` (PHASE D).
3. Call `proxyContext.setAttachedApplication(noiceAppInstance)` (NEW).
4. Run `Application.onCreate()` (PHASE E).

Step 3 must precede step 4: noice's `Application.onCreate()` (and
Hilt-generated wrappers around it) can call `getApplicationContext()`
internally during DI initialization.  The pre-M4-PRE11 ordering had no
step 3 at all; M4-PRE11 inserts it between attach and onCreate, matching
AOSP's contract that the Application is fully "attached" before onCreate
fires.

PHASE G performs the same dance for its *separate* Context instance:
build → setAttachedApplication → use as Activity.attach arg.

### 32.5 Build verification

Both DEX packages rebuilt cleanly:

```
$ scripts/build-shim-dex.sh

-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 28K aosp-libbinder-port/out/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex
Done.
```

### 32.6 On-device verification — DEFERRED

Phone (serial `cfb7c9e3`) was not reachable via ADB at the time of
this work:

```
$ /mnt/c/Users/dspfa/Dev/platform-tools/adb.exe -H localhost -P 5037 -s cfb7c9e3 shell echo test
adb.exe: device 'cfb7c9e3' not found

$ /mnt/c/Users/dspfa/Dev/platform-tools/adb.exe devices
List of devices attached
(empty)
```

The acceptance transcript at
`aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE11.log` records this
state and the acceptance command to run once the phone is reattached:

```bash
ADB="/mnt/c/Users/dspfa/Dev/platform-tools/adb.exe -H localhost -P 5037 -s cfb7c9e3"
$ADB push aosp-shim.dex /data/local/tmp/westlake/
$ADB push aosp-libbinder-port/out/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex /data/local/tmp/westlake/dex/
$ADB shell 'su -c "bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/noice-discover.sh"' \
    2>&1 | tee aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE11.log
```

### 32.7 Expected next failure

Once the phone is reattached and the acceptance command runs, M4-PRE11
should erase the `Could not find an Application` exception.  The next
discovery failure is harder to predict without running, but
working-hypothesis order:

* **(most likely)** Deeper inside Hilt DI: component creation, `@Inject`
  field population, `EntryPoints.get(Context, Class)` -- some method on
  one of the Hilt-generated singletons needs a real service (e.g.
  `ConnectivityManager`, `WorkManager`) that we haven't registered.
* **(also possible)** Activity-internal initialization that runs
  *before* Hilt's inject(): theme resolution
  (`Theme.applyStyle(int, boolean)` reading bogus density), PhoneWindow
  callback wiring, `getLayoutInflater()` reaching deeper than M4-PRE7's
  AssetManager covers.
* **(unlikely but possible)** A real Binder transaction firing into a
  service we registered (activity / power / window) -- this would mean
  M4-PRE11 was the last Context-plumbing hurdle and M4-bind is now
  unblocked.  The exit code from this run would tell us; PHASE G3+G4
  results in the report would identify the call.

If the next failure is in Hilt's component DI (option 1), M4-PRE12 will
likely be another Context-plumbing fix.  If it's a real Binder call
(option 3), the next milestone moves to **M4-bind** -- wiring the
discovered transaction into the appropriate Westlake*Service.

### 32.8 No-touch list compliance

Touched only:
* `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java` (+28 LOC,
  7 LOC re-flowed in `getApplicationContext`).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` (+43 LOC; two
  additive try/catch blocks in `phaseDE_attachAndOnCreate` and
  `phaseG_mainActivityLaunch`).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE11.log` (NEW;
  build-verified placeholder + acceptance command).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this section).
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (one row).

Did NOT touch:
* Any other `shim/java/com/westlake/services/*` file (per brief).
* `art-latest/*` (no native changes; pure Java fix).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/native/*` / `aosp-libbinder-port/out/*` (build
  outputs only).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh`, `sandbox-boot.sh` (CR7
  parallel work).
* `scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh` (D2's stable artifact).

### 32.9 Person-time

~35 minutes:

* 5 min — read `WestlakeContextImpl.getApplicationContext()` +
  M4_DISCOVERY §30 + post-M4-PRE10 log.
* 10 min — implement setter + getApplicationContext change in
  `WestlakeContextImpl.java`.
* 5 min — implement reflective `setAttachedApplication` invocation in
  `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.phaseDE_attachAndOnCreate`.
* 3 min — spot the *second* `buildProxyContext()` site in
  `phaseG_mainActivityLaunch` and add the matching wiring (PHASE G
  rebuilds the Context; without this, the Activity's `mBase` chain
  doesn't have the Application either).
* 5 min — rebuild + re-package DEX files (shim + discover).
* 5 min — attempt on-device acceptance; phone unreachable; write
  placeholder log + acceptance command.
* 5 min — docs (this section + PHASE_1_STATUS row).

## 33. CR9 — Extract `primeCharsetState` into shared `CharsetPrimer` helper (2026-05-12)

### 33.1 Background

After CR7 (EBUSY race fix) and CR8 (regression-script `--bcp-shim
--bcp-framework` flag fix) had landed, the `binder-pivot-regression.sh
--quick` suite was at **8 PASS / 4 FAIL / 1 SKIP**:

* PASS (8): sm_smoke, HelloBinder, AsInterfaceTest, BCP-shim,
  BCP-framework, ActivityServiceTest, PowerServiceTest, WindowServiceTest.
* FAIL (4): SystemServiceRouteTest, DisplayServiceTest,
  NotificationServiceTest, InputMethodServiceTest.
* SKIP (1): noice-discover (by `--quick` mode design).

All four failures shared the same root NPE chain in the dalvikvm log:

```
W class_linker.cc:6724] Tolerating clinit failure for
  Ljava/lang/VMClassLoader;: java.lang.NullPointerException: charset
```

This is the exact symptom §30 (M4-PRE10) fixed for the discovery
harness.  At that time the primer was inlined into
`NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` (Option B per the M4-PRE10 brief, because
the M4-PRE10 brief excluded `shim/java/com/westlake/engine/
WestlakeLauncher.java` from edits and the primer is private static
inside the launcher).  The four M4 service tests were never updated
because at M4-PRE10 dispatch time they were still on the build-only
"deferred on-device" status -- the Charset NPE only surfaces when the
tests actually run.

### 33.2 Choice of fix: Option A (shared helper class)

The CR9 brief offered two options:

* **Option A** -- extract the primer body into a new
  `aosp-libbinder-port/test/CharsetPrimer.java` (~140 LOC), call it from
  each test's `main()`, and refactor `NoiceDiscoverWrapper` to call the
  shared helper.  Chosen for the same DRY reasoning that CR2 used for
  `ServiceMethodMissing`: one canonical primer, four call sites, no
  drift.
* **Option B** -- copy the ~70 LOC primer body + the two helper methods
  into each of the four failing tests.  Faster but creates four
  near-identical copies that will drift apart at the first OEM-fork
  field-renaming we hit.

### 33.3 What landed

**NEW file:** `aosp-libbinder-port/test/CharsetPrimer.java` (157 LOC
total: ~60 LOC documentation block + ~70 LOC core primer + the two
private helper methods).  Public API: one static method
`CharsetPrimer.primeCharsetState()`.  Package-private API (for
testing/extending): `seedStaticFieldIfNull(Class, String, Object)`,
`setStaticField(Class, String, Object)`.

**Edits to the four failing tests:** each `main(String[])` now starts
with a 7-LOC block:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // CR9 (2026-05-12): seed Charset / StandardCharsets static state
    // BEFORE anything else so VMClassLoader.<clinit> doesn't NPE on
    // `Charset.forName("UTF-8")` and ERROR-mark StandardCharsets.
    // See aosp-libbinder-port/test/CharsetPrimer.java + M4_DISCOVERY
    // §30 (M4-PRE10) for background.
    CharsetPrimer.primeCharsetState();
    loadLib();
    ...
}
```

Order is preserved per the M4-PRE10 invariant: primer FIRST, then
`loadLib()` (which loads `android_runtime_stub` and may indirectly touch
ZipFile / VMClassLoader during its own JNI cluster init), then the rest.

**Refactor in `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java`:** the inline
`primeCharsetState()` / `seedStaticFieldIfNull()` / `setStaticField()`
methods (lines 270-353 pre-refactor; ~115 LOC) deleted; the call site at
line 180 changed from `primeCharsetState()` to
`CharsetPrimer.primeCharsetState()`.  Doc comment updated to point at
the new helper.

**Build script updates:** all three relevant scripts now compile
`CharsetPrimer.java` alongside the test sources and bundle the
resulting `CharsetPrimer.class` into the output dex:

* `aosp-libbinder-port/build_m4de_tests.sh` (3 dexes:
  Display/Notification/InputMethod) — added `CharsetPrimer` to the
  javac command, the existence check, and the `build_dex()` cp.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/build_system_service_route_test.sh` — same
  pattern.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/build_discover.sh` (NoiceDiscoverWrapper) — same
  pattern; CharsetPrimer is bundled into the dex (NOT just kept on the
  build classpath) because dalvikvm at runtime won't pull a class from
  the build-time-only stubs path.

### 33.4 LOC delta

### 33.5 Build verification

All three build scripts complete cleanly:

```
$ bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_m4de_tests.sh
=== Compiling M4d + M4e test classes ===
4 warnings (-source 8 obsolete; expected)
=== Building DEX files ===
-rw-r--r-- 15K out/DisplayServiceTest.dex
-rw-r--r-- 15K out/NotificationServiceTest.dex
-rw-r--r-- 14K out/InputMethodServiceTest.dex
Done.

$ bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_system_service_route_test.sh
-rw-r--r-- 19K out/SystemServiceRouteTest.dex
Done.

$ bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_discover.sh
-rw-r--r-- 28K out/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex
Done.
```

Each dex now contains `CharsetPrimer.class` alongside the test class +
its inner classes + AsInterfaceTest (for the println JNI helpers).

### 33.6 On-device verification

All five dexes pushed to `/data/local/tmp/westlake/dex/` on the phone
(serial `cfb7c9e3`):

```
DisplayServiceTest.dex          15160 bytes
NotificationServiceTest.dex     14356 bytes
InputMethodServiceTest.dex      14060 bytes
SystemServiceRouteTest.dex      19040 bytes
NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex        27996 bytes
```

#### 33.6a — noice-discover regression check (the M4-PRE10 baseline)

`bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/noice-discover.sh` produces
the same outcome as M4-PRE10/M4-PRE11 -- PHASE G3 PASSED, PHASE G4
fails as expected for the Hilt-onCreate wall:

```
PHASE A: 3/70 services resolved
PHASE B: 5/7 classes loadable
PHASE C: PASSED — NoiceApplication instantiated
PHASE D: PASSED (attachBaseContext with WestlakeContextImpl)
PHASE E: PASSED unexpectedly
PHASE F: drove 6 framework Singletons, 0 failed
PHASE G2: PASSED — MainActivity instantiated via Instrumentation.newActivity
PHASE G3: PASSED — Activity.attach succeeded            <-- M4-PRE10 wall cleared
PHASE G4: FAILED (expected -- diagnoses needed service)  <-- M4-PRE11 wall (separate)
```

This confirms the refactor (delegating from
`NoiceDiscoverWrapper.primeCharsetState()` to
`CharsetPrimer.primeCharsetState()`) did not regress the M4-PRE10 fix.
Full transcript: `/tmp/noice-discover-postCR9.log` on the host.

#### 33.6b — Service tests: Charset NPE is gone, but a second NPE surfaces

Running `binder-pivot-regression.sh --quick` post-CR9:

```
[ 1] sm_smoke / sandbox (M1+M2)         PASS ( 4s)
[ 2] HelloBinder (M3)                   PASS ( 4s)
[ 3] AsInterfaceTest (M3++)             PASS ( 3s)
[ 4] BCP-shim (M3+)                     PASS ( 5s)
[ 5] BCP-framework (M3+ / PF-arch-053)  PASS ( 4s)
[ 6] ActivityServiceTest (M4a)          PASS ( 3s)
[ 7] PowerServiceTest (M4-power)        PASS ( 3s)
[ 8] SystemServiceRouteTest (CR3)       FAIL ( 5s) — exit 101  <-- was exit 21 pre-CR9
[ 9] DisplayServiceTest (M4d)           FAIL ( 4s) — exit 20
[10] NotificationServiceTest (M4e)      FAIL ( 5s) — exit 20
[11] InputMethodServiceTest (M4e)       FAIL ( 4s) — exit 20
[12] WindowServiceTest (M4b)            PASS ( 3s)
[13] noice-discover (W2/M4-PRE)         SKIP — --quick mode

Results: 8 PASS  4 FAIL  1 SKIP  (total 13, 72s)
```

Same PASS/FAIL count as pre-CR9.  However the **failure mode has
advanced**:

* **No more** `Tolerating clinit failure for Ljava/lang/VMClassLoader;:
  NullPointerException: charset` log lines.  The Charset primer worked.
* `DisplayServiceTest` exit 20 (was 20 pre-CR9, same code BUT
  different reason):
  ```
  [NPE] android.app.ContextImpl android.app.ActivityThread.getSystemContext()
  [NPE]   #0 void android.hardware.display.IDisplayManager$Stub.<init>() dex_pc=5
  [NPE]   #1 void com.westlake.services.WestlakeDisplayManagerService.<init>() dex_pc=0
  DisplayServiceTest: FAIL service ctor threw: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
  ```
  Pre-CR9, `Class.forName("com.westlake.services.WestlakeDisplayManagerService")`
  itself would NPE inside `VMClassLoader.<clinit>` -- the test never
  got to the `getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()` step.  Post-CR9
  the test progresses into the ctor and dies one frame deeper:
  `IDisplayManager$Stub.<init>` calls `ActivityThread.getSystemContext()`
  which returns null because our cold-boot dalvikvm has no
  `sCurrentActivityThread` planted.
* `SystemServiceRouteTest` exit 101 (was exit 21 pre-CR9, **forward
  progress**): all the earlier route arms now succeed
  (`activity`/`power`/`layout_inflater`/`window` all return the
  expected Manager instance), and it dies at the `display` arm
  because `ServiceManager.getService("display")` returns null --
  because the `display` service was never registered by
  `ServiceRegistrar.tryRegister` (same `IDisplayManager$Stub.<init>`
  NPE inside the registrar, caught and logged-but-discarded).
* `NotificationServiceTest` and `InputMethodServiceTest` exhibit the
  symmetric pattern: `INotificationManager$Stub.<init>` and
  `IInputMethodManager$Stub.<init>` each call
  `ActivityThread.getSystemContext()` which is null.

The brief's prediction of "12/13 PASS post-CR9" assumed the Charset
NPE was the *only* obstacle.  It was the *first* obstacle; a second
obstacle is now in plain view.  The CR9 acceptance criteria of "All 4
previously-failing tests now PASS" was thus not met, but the
underlying CR9 work landed correctly and made measurable forward
progress on at least one test (SystemServiceRouteTest 21 → 101) and
qualitative forward progress on all four (Charset NPE eliminated;
crash now sits one frame deeper).

### 33.7 New failure point: `ActivityThread.getSystemContext()` returns null

The next blocker for the four M4 service tests is uniform:

```
android.app.ContextImpl android.app.ActivityThread.getSystemContext()
```

returns null in our dalvikvm sandbox because no
`ActivityThread.sCurrentActivityThread` static has been planted.  The
Android-16 `IDisplayManager$Stub.<init>` (and the analogous Stubs for
NotificationManager and IInputMethodManager) reach for it via
`Binder.setExtension` / `Binder.<init>` to install a transaction
trace -- a side-effect that ActivityServiceTest, PowerServiceTest, and
WindowServiceTest don't trigger because their Stub.<init> chains don't
reach `getSystemContext()` (different framework.jar code paths per the
Android-16 source).

Two candidate fixes for a follow-up brief (CR10 territory, not CR9):

* **(a)** Plant a synthetic `ActivityThread` (or a thin proxy) on
  `ActivityThread.sCurrentActivityThread`, with
  `sCurrentActivityThread.mSystemContext = noiceWestlakeContextImpl`.
  Equivalent to M4-PRE6 / M4-PRE8's `Unsafe.allocateInstance` pattern
  for ResourcesImpl/AssetManager.
* **(b)** Intercept the `IDisplayManager$Stub.<init>` chain via a
  shim subclass that calls `super(ActivityThread.SYSTEM)` with an
  injected context.  More invasive, less general -- option (a) covers
  many future NPE chains, option (b) only covers the three
  Stub-side-effects.

Option (a) is the architectural fix.  This CR9 work intentionally
stops here per the brief's "Do NOT add other reflective seeding beyond
the proven M4-PRE10 primer logic" anti-pattern guard.

### 33.8 No-touch list compliance

Touched only:

* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/CharsetPrimer.java` (NEW; 157 LOC).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/{DisplayServiceTest,NotificationServiceTest,InputMethodServiceTest,SystemServiceRouteTest}.java`
  (+7 LOC each as a primer call + 5-line block comment).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` (net -115 LOC:
  inline primer + helpers deleted; one delegating call + comment added).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/build_m4de_tests.sh`,
  `build_system_service_route_test.sh`, `build_discover.sh` (each +3 to
  +6 LOC for `CharsetPrimer.java` compile + bundle).
* `/tmp/regression-postCR9.log` (acceptance transcript).
* `/tmp/noice-discover-postCR9.log` (noice regression transcript).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this §33).
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (one row + summary stats bump).

Did NOT touch:

* `shim/java/*` (per brief).
* `art-latest/*` (no native changes; pure Java fix).
* `scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh` (CR8's stable artifact).
* The 8 passing tests (`HelloBinder`, `AsInterfaceTest`, `sm_smoke`,
  `BCP-shim`, `BCP-framework`, `ActivityServiceTest`,
  `PowerServiceTest`, `WindowServiceTest`) -- regression confirmed
  they still pass.

### 33.9 Person-time

~45 minutes:

* 5 min — read M4-PRE10's `primeCharsetState` inline source + verify
  the four failing tests' main() signatures.
* 10 min — create `CharsetPrimer.java` (copy/restructure M4-PRE10
  body; rewrite docstrings; verify-by-inspection no semantic change).
* 5 min — edit four test `main()`s + refactor NoiceDiscoverWrapper to
  delegate.
* 10 min — update three build scripts; rebuild all five dexes.
* 5 min — push to phone; run noice-discover regression (PHASE G3
  PASSED, identical to pre-refactor); run full regression suite.
* 10 min — root-cause the post-CR9 secondary NPE

## 34. M4-PRE12 — `WestlakeResources` populates `AssetManager.mValue`/`mOffsets` final fields (2026-05-12)

### 34.1 The post-M4-PRE11 wall

Once M4-PRE11 wired `Application` to `getApplicationContext()`, discovery
finally reached `MainActivity.onCreate(null)` (PHASE G4 invocation).  The
next failure surfaced almost immediately:

```
PHASE G3: Activity.attach(...) returned cleanly
PHASE G4: calling MainActivity.onCreate(null)
[PFCUT] Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic hit class=android.content.res.ResourcesImpl name=mConfiguration
[PFCUT] Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic hit class=android.content.res.ResourcesImpl name=mMetrics
[PFCUT] Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic hit class=android.content.res.ResourcesImpl name=mAssets
[PFCUT] Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic hit class=android.content.res.Resources name=mResourcesImpl
DISCOVER-FAIL: PHASE G4: MainActivity.onCreate(null) threw java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: null
  cause[1]: java.lang.NullPointerException: outValue
```

(See `/tmp/discover-final.log` / `noice-discover-postM4PRE11.log` for
context.)

The reflective field-access lines on every `MainActivity.onCreate`
invocation showed `WestlakeResources.createSafe()` running again — the
Hilt-augmented `Hilt_MainActivity.onCreate(Bundle)` builds an
inject-graph that walks back through `Context.getResources()` and gets a
*fresh* synthetic Resources each call.  Every fresh Resources gets a
fresh synthetic `AssetManager` via `createSyntheticAssetManager()` —
each of which carried the same defect.

### 34.2 Root cause: `mValue` and `mOffsets` are PRIVATE FINAL with field initializers

AOSP `AssetManager.java` (Android 16 framework.jar) declares two
`PRIVATE FINAL` instance fields with constructor-free initializers:

```java
@GuardedBy("this") private final TypedValue mValue   = new TypedValue();
@GuardedBy("this") private final long[]     mOffsets = new long[2];
```

When we instantiate `AssetManager` via `Unsafe.allocateInstance`
(M4-PRE8 design — `<init>` would open `framework-res.apk` via unstubbed
`ApkAssets` natives), the field initializers DO NOT RUN.  Both `mValue`
and `mOffsets` stay at JVM defaults: **null**.

`AssetManager.getResourceText(int)` (heavily used by AppCompat /
Hilt-MainActivity / `Resources.getText`) reads `mValue` directly:

```java
@Nullable CharSequence getResourceText(@StringRes int resId) {
    synchronized (this) {
        final TypedValue outValue = mValue;                  // null!
        if (getResourceValue(resId, 0, outValue, true)) {    // throws NPE
            return outValue.coerceToString();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

And `getResourceValue`'s first line is the `requireNonNull` trap:

```java
boolean getResourceValue(int resId, int densityDpi,
                         @NonNull TypedValue outValue, boolean resolveRefs) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(outValue, "outValue");           // BOOM: "outValue"
    synchronized (this) { ... }
}
```

This is what surfaced as `NullPointerException: outValue` — the
`requireNonNull` argument name became the exception message verbatim.

We confirmed this by disassembling A16 framework.jar with dexdump (`-d`
classes.dex) and reading `getResourceText:(I)Ljava/lang/CharSequence;`:

```
3e8946: 6e52 47a5 4301      |0005: invoke-virtual {v3, v4, v1, v0, v2},
                                    Landroid/content/res/AssetManager;.getResourceValue:
                                    (IILandroid/util/TypedValue;Z)Z
```

with `v0 = iget-object v3, mValue` and the entry of `getResourceValue`:

```
3e8060: 1b00 1d24 0100      |0000: const-string/jumbo v0, "outValue"
3e8066: 7120 62fe 0a00      |0003: invoke-static {v10, v0},
                                    Ljava/util/Objects;.requireNonNull:
                                    (Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
```

The literal string `"outValue"` is the second arg to `requireNonNull` —
exactly the message we saw in the failure chain.

### 34.3 Fix: plant a real `TypedValue` and `long[2]` on the synthetic AssetManager

`shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeResources.java`,
`createSyntheticAssetManager()`, +33 LOC after the existing `mApkAssets`
empty-array wiring:

```java
// M4-PRE12: plant the two PRIVATE FINAL fields that
// AOSP's AssetManager.<init> field initializers normally fill —
// we bypassed <init> via Unsafe.allocateInstance.
try {
    Class<?> typedValueCls = Class.forName("android.util.TypedValue",
            /* initialize= */ true, cl);
    Object newTypedValue = typedValueCls.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
    setField(amCls, am, "mValue", newTypedValue);
} catch (Throwable ignored) { /* harmless if absent */ }
try {
    setField(amCls, am, "mOffsets", new long[2]);
} catch (Throwable ignored) { /* harmless if absent */ }
```

`TypedValue.<init>()` is plain Java — no natives — so reflective
allocation through the public ctor works.  `mOffsets` is `[J`; a
length-2 long array matches the `new long[2]` initializer.

These are the **only** two `PRIVATE FINAL` instance fields on A16
`android.content.res.AssetManager` (verified by grepping the dexdump for
`access : 0x0012 (PRIVATE FINAL)`), so the fix is exhaustive for the
"Unsafe-allocated AssetManager has null final field" failure class.

### 34.4 Results: outValue NPE gone, MainActivity.onCreate progresses deep into AppCompat

            method 'java.lang.String java.util.Locale.toLanguageTag()'
            on a null object reference
```

The `outValue` NPE is gone.  Discovery now walks:

| Frame | Decoded |
|---|---|
| `v3.e.onCreate` | R8-renamed `AppCompatActivity.onCreate(Bundle)` |
| `androidx.fragment.app.d0.onCreate` | `FragmentActivity.onCreate(Bundle)` |
| `androidx.activity.ComponentActivity.onCreate` (dex_pc=30) | super up the chain |
| `e.p.a(Context)` | `AppCompatDelegate.create()` |
| `e.k0.d()` | `AppCompatDelegateImpl.installViewFactory()` (best guess from the chain) |
| `e.k0.p(boolean,boolean)` | `AppCompatDelegateImpl.applyDayNight(...)` |
| `e.k0.C(Configuration)` | `AppCompatDelegateImpl.updateAppLocales(Configuration)` |
| `e.b0.a(Locale)` | local helper that calls `locale.toLanguageTag()` |

The receiver of `toLanguageTag()` is null — AppCompat reads
`Configuration.getLocales().get(0)` (or our shim equivalent) and gets
null because our synthetic Configuration has no locale state populated.
That's the next blocker.

A secondary observation (not blocking): `SharedPreferences.getInt(...)`
at `MainActivity.onCreate` dex_pc=20 throws NPE (null receiver, no
SharedPreferences manager wired) but PF-arch-020 catches and the
interpreter re-throws an NPE rather than crashing — the activity
continues past it and reaches the AppCompat Locale path.

### 34.5 Where M4-PRE12's progress places us

| Path | Pre-M4-PRE12 | Post-M4-PRE12 |
|---|---|---|
| `Resources.getText(...)` → `AssetManager.getResourceText` → `getResourceValue` | NPE on `requireNonNull(outValue)` | OK — uses non-null `mValue`, falls through to native (returns 0 = "not found") |
| `Resources.getResourceTextArray(...)` (same `mValue` path) | same NPE | OK |
| `MainActivity.onCreate` (R8-shrunk Hilt path) | aborts on first AppCompat resource fetch | runs through ~70+ instructions, reaches `AppCompatDelegate.create()` and into Locale resolution |
| `SharedPreferences.getInt` at MainActivity dex_pc=20 | (not yet reached) | recoverable NPE per PF-arch-020 (interp throws; activity continues) |
| `Locale.toLanguageTag` in `AppCompatDelegateImpl.updateAppLocales` | (not yet reached) | NEW BLOCKER (null Locale receiver from empty `Configuration.locales`) |

### 34.6 What's NOT working (M4-PRE13 / next-milestone candidates)

- **`Configuration.getLocales()` / `Configuration.locale`** — `WestlakeResources.buildDefaultConfiguration()`
  calls `c.setToDefaults()` then sets densityDpi / fontScale / width /
  height / orientation, but does NOT explicitly initialize `mLocaleList`
  (or `locale` legacy field).  AOSP `Configuration.setToDefaults()` is
  supposed to set `LocaleList.getEmptyLocaleList()` but in our pre-boot
  state the LocaleList class may be in clinit-failed mode (similar to
  the Charset issue M4-PRE10 cleared), leaving the locale state null.
  - **Solution shape**: extend `buildDefaultConfiguration()` to
    explicitly plant a `LocaleList` containing `Locale.ROOT` or `Locale.US`,
    and write to both `Configuration.locale` and `Configuration.mLocaleList`
    fields reflectively in case `setToDefaults` is incomplete.  Sub-30 min
    fix, same shape as the other field-planting in WestlakeResources.

- **`SharedPreferences.getInt` null receiver** — recoverable but indicates
  noice's `MainActivity` reads from a SharedPreferences pulled out of an
  inject-graph singleton at very first onCreate line.  Without a real
  SharedPreferences implementation, the activity will degrade gracefully
  (we hope) but Hilt may eventually try to write back to it.  Defer
  until a concrete failure surfaces.

### 34.7 Acceptance test status

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| `WestlakeResources.java` edit compiles (javac + d8 green) | PASS |
| `aosp-shim.dex` builds (1553432 bytes, +118944 from M4-PRE11) | PASS |
| Discovery reaches PHASE G4 `MainActivity.onCreate(null)` invocation | PASS |
| Discovery: `[PFCUT] Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic hit class=android.content.res.AssetManager name=mValue` | PASS NEW (proves the fix actually executes) |
| Discovery: `[PFCUT] Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic hit class=android.content.res.AssetManager name=mOffsets` | PASS NEW |
| Discovery: NPE message `outValue` | GONE |
| Discovery: progresses into `AppCompatDelegateImpl` / `ComponentActivity.onCreate` chain | PASS |
| New failure: `Locale.toLanguageTag()` on null receiver in R8-renamed AppCompat locale code | PASS (the failure migrated; M4-PRE13 territory) |
| No native rebuild needed (dalvikvm bytes unchanged) | PASS (pure Java fix) |

### 34.8 Person-time

~50 minutes:

* 10 min — read M4-PRE12 brief + M4_DISCOVERY §23 (M4-PRE8 deliverables)
  + post-M4-PRE11 log; confirm the `outValue` NPE shape.
* 10 min — find call site by disassembling A16 framework.jar
  (dexdump from android-sdk/build-tools/34.0.0) and reading
  `getResourceText` + `getResourceValue` bytecode; confirm AOSP's
  `Objects.requireNonNull(outValue, "outValue")` is the throw site and
  trace back to `mValue` field initializer.
* 5 min — enumerate `0x0012 (PRIVATE FINAL)` instance fields on A16
  AssetManager (only two: `mValue` and `mOffsets`); decide the
  fix scope is exhaustive.
* 5 min — edit `WestlakeResources.createSyntheticAssetManager()`
  to plant `TypedValue` + `long[2]`.
* 5 min — rebuild aosp-shim.dex; push to phone; run noice-discover.
* 5 min — verify outValue NPE gone, decode new failure (Locale.toLanguageTag),
  capture transcript.
* 10 min — write this §33 + PHASE_1_STATUS row.

### 34.9 No-touch list compliance

Touched only:

* `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeResources.java` (+33 LOC in
  `createSyntheticAssetManager`).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE12.log` (NEW;
  on-device transcript).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this section).
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (one row added).

Did NOT touch:

* `art-latest/stubs/assetmanager_jni_stub.cc` (decided unnecessary; the
  outValue NPE is purely Java-side; defensive null checks in the native
  would just mask the bug without unblocking — the Java caller still
  NPEs because it expects outValue to be populated).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` (no test harness
  changes needed; existing failure surfaced the bug clearly).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/*` other than the new log (CR9's exclusive
  zone).
* `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java` (recent
  M4-PRE11 work; out of scope here).
* All other service impl classes, `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh`, `sandbox-boot.sh`,
  `aosp-libbinder-port/native/*`, `scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh`.

### 34.11 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE12 (AssetManager.mValue / mOffsets final-field planting) is
complete and on-device verified.** The `NullPointerException: outValue`
that blocked every `MainActivity.onCreate` resource lookup is gone:
AOSP's `getResourceText` now reads a non-null `TypedValue` from the
synthetic AssetManager's `mValue` field and successfully delegates to
the native stub (which returns "not found" — acceptable for boot).
Discovery progresses through several AppCompat layers including
`ComponentActivity.onCreate(Bundle)` (super of `FragmentActivity` of
`AppCompatActivity` of `MainActivity`), `AppCompatDelegate.create()`,
and into AppCompat's locale handling, where it terminates on
`Locale.toLanguageTag()` invoked on a null receiver.  That's the
M4-PRE13 candidate: extend `WestlakeResources.buildDefaultConfiguration()`
to plant a non-empty `LocaleList` (e.g. `Locale.US` or `Locale.ROOT`).
Estimated 20-30 minutes for that fix.  Total time on M4-PRE12: ~50
minutes (per §33.8 breakdown).

## 35. M4-PRE13 — `WestlakeResources` plants Locale + LocaleList on synthetic Configuration (2026-05-12)

### 35.1 Symptom (handed off from M4-PRE12)

M4-PRE12 cleared the `AssetManager.mValue`/`mOffsets` NPE chain, which
advanced discovery from `ResourcesImpl.getValue` deep into AppCompat's
`installViewFactory` → `applyDayNight` chain.  The new wall:

```
[NPE] String java.util.Locale.toLanguageTag()
[NPE]   #0 java.util.Locale e.b0.a(java.util.Locale)
[NPE]   #1 void e.k0.C(android.content.res.Configuration)   ← updateAppLocales
[NPE]   #2 ...AppCompatDelegateImpl.applyDayNight()
[NPE]   #3 ComponentActivity.onCreate(Bundle)
```

R8-obfuscated AppCompat's `updateAppLocales(Configuration cfg)` calls
`cfg.getLocales().get(0).toLanguageTag()`, and on our synthetic
Configuration `getLocales()` returns an empty `LocaleList` whose `get(0)`
yields `null`.  `setToDefaults()` in our cold-boot dalvikvm leaves
`mLocaleList` / `locale` / `mLocale` null (presumably because the
static `LocaleList.getDefault()` machinery is not initialized in our
environment).

### 35.2 Fix

Extend `WestlakeResources.buildDefaultConfiguration()` with a private
`plantLocaleState(Configuration)` helper that:

1. Constructs `new LocaleList(Locale.US)` via reflection (class lookup +
   public ctor with `Locale.class` param).
2. Attempts `Configuration.setLocales(LocaleList)` first (public API since
   API 24); falls back to reflective `mLocaleList` field write if the
   setter is absent.
3. Reflectively sets the legacy `locale` field on `Configuration`
   (still read by some Android 11- compat paths and library code that
   bypasses `getLocales()`).
4. Attempts to set `mLocale` cache field (some AOSP variants carry it;
   our build's Configuration does not — harmless miss, logged by the
   `Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic miss` PFCUT trace).

All three writes are wrapped in `try { ... } catch (Throwable ignored)`
because:

* `android.os.LocaleList` may be absent in some shim configurations.
* `mLocale` is variant-specific.
* Direct-field fallback is only attempted if the public setter throws.

`Locale.US` is chosen because:

* noice's manifest does not override default locale.
* `Locale.US.toLanguageTag()` returns `"en-US"` — non-empty,
  well-formed BCP 47 tag.
* Matches the OnePlus 6 / discovery harness expected default.

### 35.3 Touched files

```
shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeResources.java  (+58 LOC)
```

The +58 LOC comprises:

* 1-line call site: `plantLocaleState(c);` in
  `buildDefaultConfiguration()`.
* 57-line new private static helper `plantLocaleState(Configuration)`
  with three try/catch blocks (LocaleList via setter or field, legacy
  `locale`, `mLocale` cache).

No native changes.  No new imports — `android.os.LocaleList` and
`java.lang.reflect.Method` / `Field` are reached via `Class.forName`
and via existing reflect imports.

### 35.4 Build

```
$ bash scripts/build-shim-dex.sh
=== Done: aosp-shim.dex (1553864 bytes) ===
```

(was 1553432 → 1553864, +432 bytes for the new helper).

### 35.5 On-device verification

Pushed to `/data/local/tmp/westlake/` and re-ran `noice-discover.sh`.

Transcript: `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postM4PRE13.log`
(28 407 bytes).

Key observations:

* **`Locale.toLanguageTag` NPE: GONE.**  Log no longer contains the
  string `toLanguageTag`, `getLocales`, or `updateAppLocales`.
* **`Configuration.locale` field was found and written** — PFCUT trace
  `Class.getDeclaredField intrinsic hit class=android.content.res.Configuration name=locale`.
* `mLocale` field absent on this AOSP variant (`...intrinsic miss
  class=android.content.res.Configuration name=mLocale`) — harmless,
  handled by the try/catch.
* **Discovery advances past dex_pc=193 into `e.k0.p(boolean,boolean)
  dex_pc=299`** (vs. earlier <200).  This is the
  `AppCompatDelegateImpl.applyDayNight()` continuation that previously
  blocked on `updateAppLocales`.
* `MainActivity.onCreate(null)` actually starts executing — first
  Kotlin bytecode at dex_pc=20 calls
  `SharedPreferences.getInt(String, int)` on a null receiver and is
  caught by `PF-arch-020` (null-receiver interface invoke, soft NPE,
  recovered).
* **New failure point:**
  ```
  [NPE] android.content.res.CompatibilityInfo
        android.view.DisplayAdjustments.getCompatibilityInfo()
  [NPE]   #0 ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl(...) (dex_pc=36)
  [NPE]   #1 ResourcesImpl.updateConfiguration(...) (dex_pc=1)
  [NPE]   #2 Resources.updateConfiguration(...) (dex_pc=2)
  [NPE]   #3 Resources.updateConfiguration(cfg, dm) (dex_pc=1)
  [NPE]   #4 e.k0.p(boolean, boolean) (dex_pc=299)
  [NPE]   #5 e.k0.d() (dex_pc=4)
  [NPE]   #6 e.p.a(Context) (dex_pc=130)
  [NPE]   #7 ComponentActivity.onCreate(Bundle) (dex_pc=30)
  ```
  AppCompat's `applyDayNight` is now successfully reading the locale,
  then calls `Resources.updateConfiguration(cfg, dm)` which fans out to
  `ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl(cfg, dm, compatInfo, public)`.
  `ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl` reads `mDisplayAdjustments` and
  calls `getCompatibilityInfo()` on it — but `mDisplayAdjustments` is
  null on our synthetic ResourcesImpl.

### 35.8 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE13 (Locale + LocaleList planting on synthetic Configuration)
is complete and on-device verified.**  The `Locale.toLanguageTag()` NPE
that blocked `AppCompatDelegateImpl.applyDayNight` →
`updateAppLocales(Configuration)` is gone.  Discovery now reaches
`MainActivity.onCreate` body and progresses through AppCompat's
`installViewFactory` past dex_pc=299, terminating at
`ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl` dex_pc=36 on a NPE from
`mDisplayAdjustments` being null.  M4-PRE14 should plant a minimal
`DisplayAdjustments` on `ResourcesImpl.mDisplayAdjustments` in
`WestlakeResources.buildReflective()` — same one-line `setField` pattern
as `mConfiguration`/`mMetrics`/`mAccessLock`.  Total time on M4-PRE13:
~25 minutes (read brief + locate helper + write 58 LOC + build + push +
verify + docs).

### 35.9 Anti-pattern audit

* No per-app branches: `plantLocaleState` is unconditional architecture,
  no `if (app.equals("noice"))` checks.
* No speculative population: only `mLocaleList`, `locale`, `mLocale` —
  exactly the three fields the AppCompat NPE pointed at.  Other
  Configuration fields (`uiMode`, `screenLayout`, etc.) deferred until
  discovery surfaces them.
* No `Locale.ROOT` substitution: chose `Locale.US` because its
  `toLanguageTag()` returns the non-empty `"en-US"` which is what most
  library code expects to parse without surprises.

## 36. M4-PRE14 — `WestlakeResources` plants `DisplayAdjustments` on synthetic `ResourcesImpl.mDisplayAdjustments` (2026-05-12)

### 36.1 Symptom (handed off from M4-PRE13)

M4-PRE13 cleared the `Locale.toLanguageTag()` NPE chain that blocked
AppCompat's `updateAppLocales`.  Discovery now advances past dex_pc=299
of `e.k0.p(true, true)` (delegate.installViewFactory) and into
`Resources.updateConfiguration(cfg, dm)` → `ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl(...)`.
The new wall:

```
[NPE] android.content.res.CompatibilityInfo
      android.view.DisplayAdjustments.getCompatibilityInfo()
[NPE]   #0 ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl(...) (dex_pc=36)
[NPE]   #1 ResourcesImpl.updateConfiguration(...) (dex_pc=1)
[NPE]   #2 Resources.updateConfiguration(...) (dex_pc=2)
[NPE]   #3 Resources.updateConfiguration(cfg, dm) (dex_pc=1)
[NPE]   #4 e.k0.p(boolean, boolean) (dex_pc=299)
[NPE]   #5 e.k0.d() (dex_pc=4)                ← installViewFactory
[NPE]   #6 e.p.a(Context) (dex_pc=130)
[NPE]   #7 ComponentActivity.onCreate(Bundle) (dex_pc=30)
```

AOSP's `ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl(cfg, dm, compatInfo, public)`
reads `mDisplayAdjustments.getCompatibilityInfo()` unconditionally at
dex_pc=36 to compose the effective compat info.  Our synthetic
`ResourcesImpl` (allocated via `Unsafe.allocateInstance` in M4-PRE6's
`buildReflective`) has `mDisplayAdjustments` at JVM-default null,
since we never populated it.

### 36.2 Fix

Extend `WestlakeResources.buildReflective(Configuration, DisplayMetrics)`
with a private `plantDisplayAdjustments(implCls, impl, cl)` helper that:

1. Looks up `android.view.DisplayAdjustments` via `Class.forName(...,
   initialize=true, cl)`.
2. Calls the public no-arg ctor `new DisplayAdjustments()`.  AOSP's
   ctor (present since API 17) initializes `mCompatInfo` to
   `CompatibilityInfo.DEFAULT_COMPATIBILITY_INFO`.
3. Defensive check: if `mCompatInfo` is null on the returned instance
   (variant-specific or cold-boot artifact), reflectively planting
   `CompatibilityInfo.DEFAULT_COMPATIBILITY_INFO` on `mCompatInfo`.
4. Falls back to `Unsafe.allocateInstance(DisplayAdjustments.class)` +
   reflective `mCompatInfo` write if the public ctor throws (should not
   happen — ctor is parameterless and plain Java).
5. Plants the result on `impl.mDisplayAdjustments` via the existing
   `setField` helper.

All paths swallow throwables: if planting fails the field stays null
and the original NPE re-surfaces, preserving the discovery signal.

### 36.3 Touched files

```
shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeResources.java  (+102 LOC)
```

The +102 LOC comprises:

* 1-line call site: `plantDisplayAdjustments(implCls, impl, cl);` in
  `buildReflective` after the existing `mConfiguration` / `mMetrics` /
  `mAccessLock` plants.
* ~12 lines of inline comment block above the call documenting AOSP's
  `updateConfigurationImpl` dex_pc=36 access pattern and citing
  M4-PRE13's log.
* ~89 lines of new private static helper
  `plantDisplayAdjustments(Class<?>, Object, ClassLoader)` with the
  ctor / Unsafe fallback / defensive `mCompatInfo` re-plant logic and
  a multi-paragraph docstring.

No native changes.  No new imports — `android.view.DisplayAdjustments`
and `android.content.res.CompatibilityInfo` are reached via
`Class.forName`.

### 36.4 Build

```
$ bash scripts/build-shim-dex.sh
=== Done: aosp-shim.dex (1554412 bytes) ===
```

(was 1553864 → 1554412, +548 bytes for the new helper).

### 36.5 On-device verification (BLOCKED by device-state SIGBUS regression)

Pushed to `/data/local/tmp/westlake/` and re-ran `noice-discover.sh`
**four times** (one initial + three retries with progressively cleaner
device state).  All four runs aborted at PHASE B with a
**reproducible SIGBUS at the same fault address**:

```
*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
Fatal signal 7 (SIGBUS), code 1 (BUS_ADRALN) fault addr 0x6f6874656d2063
OS: Linux 4.9.337-g2e921a892c03 (aarch64)
Thread: 10625 "main-256mb"
     pc: 0x006f6874656d2063   sp: 0x0000007dd3b43fb0
[PFCUT-SIGNAL] top_quick_method=...native=1
  java.lang.String dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader.toString()
  at dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader.toString(Native method)
  at NoiceDiscoverWrapper.phaseB_classLoad(NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java:326)
```

The fault address `0x6f6874656d2063` decodes (little-endian) to ASCII
`"c method\0"` — string-literal text bytes loaded into the program
counter, classic stack-bounce / corrupted-frame signature.

**Causation regression test:** swapped the M4-PRE13 DEX
(1553864 bytes, identical md5 to the verified M4-PRE13 build) back onto
the device and re-ran.  The SIGBUS reproduces **at the same fault
address** with the M4-PRE13 DEX.  Therefore the SIGBUS is a pre-existing
device-state regression (PF-arch-053-class flake), NOT caused by the
M4-PRE14 plant.

**Reachability proof for M4-PRE14 code:** the plant only executes
inside `WestlakeResources.buildReflective(...)`, which is invoked from
`createSafe()` during PHASE D / G's `attachBaseContext` path (Activity
construction).  PHASE B (PathClassLoader instantiation) is several
phases earlier; the new `plantDisplayAdjustments` helper is unreachable
from any code path that runs before PHASE D.  No code added in M4-PRE14
could have caused a PHASE B SIGBUS.

### 36.6 Where we are now

Activity construction lineage (forward extrapolation from M4-PRE13's
successful run plus M4-PRE14's plant):

```
NoiceApplication.attachBaseContext   ✅
NoiceApplication.onCreate            ✅ (PHASE F)
Instrumentation.newActivity          ✅ (PHASE G2)
Activity.attach                      ✅ (PHASE G3)
MainActivity.onCreate dex_pc=0..20   ✅ (super call started)
  ComponentActivity.onCreate dex_pc=30
    AppCompatDelegateImpl.attachBaseContext path
      e.p.a (delegate.<>) dex_pc=130
        e.k0.d() dex_pc=4 (delegate.installViewFactory)
          e.k0.p(true, true) dex_pc=0..299
            updateAppLocales(cfg)            ✅ M4-PRE13
            Resources.updateConfiguration(cfg, dm)
              ResourcesImpl.updateConfigurationImpl(...) dex_pc=36
                mDisplayAdjustments.getCompatibilityInfo()  ✅ M4-PRE14 plant
                  → continues into compat-info composition  ← next NPE here
```

Until the device-state SIGBUS is cleared (independent operational
issue, likely needs a `setenforce`/`reboot`-class recovery action),
the exact next failure point cannot be confirmed empirically.

### 36.8 One-paragraph forward recommendation

**M4-PRE14 (`DisplayAdjustments` planting on synthetic `ResourcesImpl`)
is complete at the source level.**  The +102 LOC implements the same
plant pattern as M4-PRE12 (`AssetManager.mValue`/`mOffsets`) and
M4-PRE13 (Configuration locale state), reflectively constructing a
`DisplayAdjustments` via its public no-arg ctor and writing it to
`ResourcesImpl.mDisplayAdjustments` from `buildReflective(...)`, with
a defensive `mCompatInfo` re-plant for variants where the ctor leaves
the field null.  On-device verification is **blocked by an
unrelated PHASE B SIGBUS** that reproduces with the verified M4-PRE13
DEX (proven by a revert-test), so the next agent should first
investigate the device-state regression before chasing the next
`updateConfigurationImpl` NPE.  Total time on M4-PRE14: ~30 minutes
(read brief + locate plant site + write 102 LOC + build + push + 4×
discovery attempts + causation revert-test + docs).

### 36.9 Anti-pattern audit

* No per-app branches: `plantDisplayAdjustments` is unconditional
  architecture, no `if (app.equals("noice"))` checks.
* No speculative population: only `mDisplayAdjustments` (the field the
  NPE explicitly pointed at) plus a defensive `mCompatInfo` re-plant
  on the planted DisplayAdjustments (still M4-PRE14 scope — required
  to make the planted object useful when `getCompatibilityInfo()` is
  called).
* No `Unsafe.allocateInstance` for `DisplayAdjustments`: the public
  no-arg ctor is plain Java with no natives, so we use it first.  The
  Unsafe fallback is dead code in practice; kept for resilience against
  hypothetical variants where the ctor throws.

## 37. CR10 — Plant `ActivityThread.sCurrentActivityThread` + synthetic Context-with-PermissionEnforcer for cold-boot Stub() ctors (2026-05-12)

### 37.1 Background

CR9 (§33) cleared the `VMClassLoader.<clinit>` charset NPE for the four
M4 service tests (`DisplayServiceTest`, `NotificationServiceTest`,
`InputMethodServiceTest`, `SystemServiceRouteTest`).  Discovery on the
post-CR9 regression (`/tmp/regression-postCR9.log`) exposed the *next*
blocker, predicted in §33.7/§33.10:

```
DisplayServiceTest: FAIL service ctor threw: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
```

The Stub() default ctors of `IDisplayManager`, `INotificationManager`,
and `IInputMethodManager` (used by `WestlakeDisplayManagerService` and
its siblings via `super()`) call:

```java
this(PermissionEnforcer.fromContext(
        ActivityThread.currentActivityThread().getSystemContext()))
```

In a cold dalvikvm `ActivityThread.sCurrentActivityThread` is null, so
`currentActivityThread()` returns null and `.getSystemContext()` NPEs.
M4a (Activity), M4-power, and M4b (Window) already side-step this by
calling the alternate `Stub(PermissionEnforcer)` overload with a
`NoopPermissionEnforcer` (see `WestlakeWindowManagerService.java`),
but the brief explicitly forbids touching the shim's M4d/M4e service
files, so the fix has to land outside them.

### 37.2 Two-layer fix

A single `Unsafe.allocateInstance` of `ActivityThread` + plant on
`sCurrentActivityThread` is NOT enough.  Empirical drill-down (CR10
added a `cause`-chain dump to `DisplayServiceTest`'s ctor failure path)
showed the failure shape one layer deeper than the brief predicted:

```
DisplayServiceTest:   [depth=0] java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: null
DisplayServiceTest:   [depth=1] java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: enforcer cannot be null
```

The `Stub(PermissionEnforcer)` overload (the same one M4a uses) checks
`if (enforcer == null) throw new IAE("enforcer cannot be null")`.  So
the actual chain is:

1. `currentActivityThread()` → our planted ActivityThread (OK).
2. `getSystemContext()` → our planted `mSystemContext` (OK).
3. `PermissionEnforcer.fromContext(ctx)` →
   `(PermissionEnforcer) ctx.getSystemService("permission_enforcer")`.
   A plain Unsafe-allocated `ContextImpl` returns null here because
   `ContextImpl.getSystemService` routes through
   `android.app.SystemServiceRegistry`, whose `<clinit>` has been
   ERROR-marked in our dalvikvm (logged earlier as `Tolerating clinit
   failure for SystemServiceRegistry`), and subsequent static-method
   calls just return null rather than throwing.
4. fromContext returns null → Stub(null) throws IAE.

The fix therefore plants TWO things on the synthetic ActivityThread:

* `sCurrentActivityThread` ← the synthetic ActivityThread itself.
* `mSystemContext` ← a tiny `ContextWrapper` subclass
  (`CharsetPrimer.BootstrapContext`) whose `getSystemService` returns
  a planted `PermissionEnforcer` for the string `"permission_enforcer"`,
  and falls through to `super.getSystemService` (which NPEs on the null
  `mBase`) for anything else.

The `PermissionEnforcer` itself is constructed via its public
`<init>(Context)` ctor — no natives, no `ActivityManager.getService`
chain — passing `null` for the Context (the PE only reads `mContext`
in `enforcePermission(...)` paths, which our Tier-1 service methods
never call).

`Field.set` on Android does not reliably honour subtype assignability
when the field's declared type (`ContextImpl` here) is narrower than
the runtime type we want to plant (`BootstrapContext`).  To keep the
plant robust we use a `sun.misc.Unsafe.putObject(obj, offset, value)`
helper (`CharsetPrimer.setInstanceFieldUnsafe`) that bypasses any
runtime type check.  Pattern mirrors M4-PRE6 (ResourcesImpl) and
M4-PRE8 (AssetManager); the Unsafe-alloc + putObject combo is the
established Westlake "plant synthetic AOSP framework object" idiom.

### 37.3 What landed

* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/CharsetPrimer.java` — added
  `primeActivityThread()` public method (~70 LOC core + ~70 LOC
  Javadoc/comments), plus three helpers:
  * `setInstanceField` — best-effort `Field.set` (used in the
    fallback path).
  * `setInstanceFieldUnsafe` — `objectFieldOffset` + `putObject`
    bypass (used for the `mSystemContext` plant where field type is
    narrower than runtime type).
  * `unsafeAllocateInstance` — copies the M4-PRE6 pattern.
  * Nested `private static final class BootstrapContext extends
    android.content.ContextWrapper` — overrides `getSystemService` only.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/DisplayServiceTest.java`
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NotificationServiceTest.java`
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/InputMethodServiceTest.java`
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/SystemServiceRouteTest.java`
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java`
  — each `main()` calls `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread()`
  immediately after the existing `CharsetPrimer.primeCharsetState()`
  call (5 LOC per test + a 5-line block comment per test pointing at
  §35/§37).

Build scripts unchanged — `CharsetPrimer.java` was already in the
javac sources list (CR9), and the nested `BootstrapContext` and new
helpers come along automatically because dx packages all of
`CharsetPrimer*.class`.

### 37.4 LOC delta

| File | +LOC | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `CharsetPrimer.java` | +175 | primeActivityThread + 2 helpers + nested BootstrapContext + Javadoc |
| 5 × test files       | +5–7 each = +28 | one call site + block comment |
| **Total**            | **~203**          | within "1-2 field plants" envelope predicted by brief |

The brief predicted "ActivityThread will likely be 1-2 field plants"
which was correct at the AOSP level (`sCurrentActivityThread` +
`mSystemContext`); the surprise was that the synthetic ContextImpl
itself needs to be a custom Context subclass (not a bare Unsafe
allocation) to surface a non-null `PermissionEnforcer` from
`getSystemService("permission_enforcer")`.

### 37.5 Build verification

Builds clean: `bash scripts/build-shim-dex.sh` → unchanged shim,
`bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_m4de_tests.sh` →
DisplayServiceTest.dex, NotificationServiceTest.dex,
InputMethodServiceTest.dex; `build_system_service_route_test.sh` and
`build_discover.sh` likewise.  No compile errors.

### 37.6 Diagnostic enhancement (transient, in DisplayServiceTest)

To root-cause the post-primer failure mode, CR10 added a `cause`-chain
dump immediately after the `service ctor threw` log line in
`DisplayServiceTest.run()`.  It iterates `t.getCause()` up to 8 levels
deep and prints the class name + message (and the top 8 frames of the
stack trace if any) via `eprintln` so the output is visible even when
`System.err`'s `PrintStream` is broken (which causes
`Throwable.printStackTrace()` to log `[RT] Throwable.printStackTrace(null)`
and swallow the trace).  This produced the
`IllegalArgumentException: enforcer cannot be null` evidence that
pointed at the deeper PermissionEnforcer issue.  Kept in the source
because it's free diagnostic value on any future Stub-ctor regression.

### 37.7 Anti-pattern audit

* No per-app branches: `primeActivityThread()` is unconditional
  bootstrap, no `if (app.equals("noice"))` checks.
* No `Unsafe.allocateInstance` on `WestlakeContextImpl` or our own
  services: only on `android.app.ActivityThread` (the AOSP-allowed
  case per the brief) and on `android.app.ContextImpl` in the fallback
  path (only when the primary BootstrapContext build fails).
* `BootstrapContext` does not extend our own service classes — it
  extends AOSP `android.content.ContextWrapper`, a stable public API.
* No reach into `art-latest/stubs/` or `shim/java/com/westlake/services/*`.
* Idempotent: re-calling `primeActivityThread()` short-circuits if
  `sCurrentActivityThread` is already non-null.

### 37.8 Section-index entry (post-CR10)

## 38. M4c — WestlakePackageManagerService (binder-backed PackageManager) — 2026-05-12

### 38.1 Goal

Register a binder service under the name `"package"` so callers using
`ServiceManager.getService("package")` (Hilt's package-monitor probes,
`AppOpsManager` internal lookups, and the `PackageManager` route in
`Context.getSystemService("package")`) get a real
`IPackageManager.Stub` implementor instead of `null`.  Distinct from
M4-PRE5's `WestlakePackageManagerStub`, which extends
`android.content.pm.PackageManager` (an abstract class, not a binder)
and is returned from `WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager()` to
satisfy `Context.getPackageManager()`-based local lookups.

### 38.2 Surface

The Android 16 `IPackageManager` AIDL has **223 abstract methods**
(dexdump on `/system/framework/framework.jar` from the deployed phone,
2026-05-12; counts cross-checked against
`https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/tags/android-16.0.0_r1/core/java/android/content/pm/IPackageManager.aidl`).

Tier-1 set (15 methods, real impls):

| Method | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `getPackageInfo(String,long,int)` | Cached `PackageInfo` if package matches ours; else null |
| `getApplicationInfo(String,long,int)` | Cached `ApplicationInfo` if package matches ours; else null |
| `getInstalledPackages(long,int)` | `ParceledListSlice` with our single `PackageInfo` |
| `getInstalledApplications(long,int)` | `ParceledListSlice` with our single `ApplicationInfo` |
| `resolveIntent(Intent,String,long,int)` | `null` (no out-of-package activities resolve in sandbox) |
| `resolveService(Intent,String,long,int)` | `null` (same rationale) |
| `hasSystemFeature(String,int)` | `false` — sandbox has no hardware/system features |
| `getNameForUid(int)` | Our package name (single-process sandbox) |
| `getPackagesForUid(int)` | `String[]{ourPackageName}` |
| `getInstallerPackageName(String)` | `null` (sideloaded / dev-deployed) |
| `getServiceInfo(ComponentName,long,int)` | Synthetic `ServiceInfo` with our `ApplicationInfo` for components in our package; null otherwise |
| `getActivityInfo(ComponentName,long,int)` | Synthetic `ActivityInfo`; same package gating |
| `getReceiverInfo(ComponentName,long,int)` | Synthetic `ActivityInfo` (real `IPackageManager` shares `ActivityInfo` for receivers) |
| `getProviderInfo(ComponentName,long,int)` | `null` (no providers in sandbox) |
| `queryContentProviders(String,int,long,String)` | Empty `ParceledListSlice` |

Remaining **208 methods** throw `ServiceMethodMissing.fail("package", "<name>")`
(CR2 pattern), so any unobserved transaction surfaces an immediately
diagnosable stack trace rather than masquerading as success.

### 38.3 Constructor bypass

`IPackageManager.Stub`'s deprecated no-arg ctor calls
`PermissionEnforcer.fromContext(ActivityThread.currentActivityThread().getSystemContext())`
which NPEs in the cold-boot dalvikvm sandbox (matching the path
M4a/M4b/M4-power all bypass).  M4c follows the same fix: call
`super(new NoopPermissionEnforcer())` where `NoopPermissionEnforcer`
subclasses `android.os.PermissionEnforcer` via the protected no-arg ctor
and lets `mContext` stay null.

### 38.4 Compile-time stubs

`IPackageManager` references several `@hide` types that the public
SDK android.jar doesn't expose.  Added compile-time stubs (each
stripped from `aosp-shim.dex` via `scripts/framework_duplicates.txt`
so the real framework.jar class wins at runtime):

| Stub | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `android.content.pm.IPackageManager` | 223-method abstract interface + `Stub(PermissionEnforcer)` ctor surface |
| `android.content.pm.ArchivedPackageParcel` | Empty marker class (parameter type) |
| `android.content.pm.IPackageInstaller` | Binder interface + `Stub` shell |
| `android.content.pm.IPackageMoveObserver` | Binder interface + `Stub` shell |
| `android.content.pm.IPackageDeleteObserver2` | Binder interface + `Stub` shell |
| `android.content.pm.IDexModuleRegisterCallback` | Binder interface + `Stub` shell |
| `android.content.pm.IOnChecksumsReadyListener` | Binder interface + `Stub` shell |
| `android.content.pm.SuspendDialogInfo` | Empty marker class |
| `android.content.pm.dex.IArtManager` | Binder interface + `Stub` shell |
| `android.content.pm.PackageManager.Property` (nested) | Empty marker — referenced from `getPropertyAsUser` |

`framework_duplicates.txt` gained 8 entries
(`android/content/pm/IPackageManager` and the eight @hide types
above).

### 38.5 ServiceRegistrar wiring

`ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices()` gains one new `tryRegister`
call for `"package"` →
`com.westlake.services.WestlakePackageManagerService`.  Idempotent in
the same way as the other six services (M4a/b/d/e + M4-power); a
failed `addService` does not poison subsequent retries.

### 38.6 SystemServiceWrapperRegistry wiring (optional)

The brief notes that `Context.getSystemService("package")` is rare —
most callers use `Context.getPackageManager()` which is routed through
`WestlakeContextImpl.getPackageManager()` → M4-PRE5's
`WestlakePackageManagerStub`.  Even so, CR5's wrap-registry gained a
`"package"` case wrapping the binder in a reflective
`android.app.ApplicationPackageManager(ContextImpl, IPackageManager)`
ctor, with fall-through to the raw `IPackageManager` interface if the
real Manager ctor shape isn't found.

### 38.7 Synthetic smoke test (PackageServiceTest)

`aosp-libbinder-port/test/PackageServiceTest.java` mirrors the shape
of `PowerServiceTest` / `WindowServiceTest`:

1. Construct `WestlakePackageManagerService` via reflection.
2. Verify `IBinder.queryLocalInterface("android.content.pm.IPackageManager")` returns SAME service.
3. `ServiceManager.addService("package", binder)`.
4. Exercise `ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices()`.
5. `ServiceManager.getService("package")` round-trip.
6. `IPackageManager.Stub.asInterface(b)` — verify SAME service (direct dispatch active).
7. Tier-1 spot checks: `getPackageInfo(ourPackage)`, `getApplicationInfo(ourPackage)`, `getNameForUid`, `getPackagesForUid`, `hasSystemFeature`, `getInstalledPackages`.
8. Foreign-package `getPackageInfo("com.bogus.example")` returns `null`.
9. `ServiceManager.listServices()` contains `"package"`.

PASS = exit 0.  Numbered failure codes (20…121) point at the failed
step; the existing `AsInterfaceTest.{println,eprintln}` natives are
re-used (the AsInterfaceTest.class is bundled into
PackageServiceTest.dex), mirroring the M4-power test strategy.

### 38.8 Build verification

```
$ bash scripts/build-shim-dex.sh
... 804 class files ...
=== Done: aosp-shim.dex (1577644 bytes) ===          # was 1577024

$ bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_package_service_test.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 17K May 12 18:55 .../out/PackageServiceTest.dex
Done.
```

Both build clean.  IPackageManager method count cross-checked by
diffing the interface's method names against the service's `@Override`
method names: 223 in both, no missing or extra entries on the service
side (the only diff is the private `matchesOurPackage` helper).

### 38.9 On-device test deferral

Phone serial `cfb7c9e3` was offline (`adb devices` shows empty list,
same as M4-PRE14's deferral) during the M4c run window — the previous
`emulator-5554` entry was `offline` and `kill-server`/`start-server`
gave back an empty device list.  PackageServiceTest.dex (17 KB) and the
updated aosp-shim.dex are staged for push:

```
ADB="/mnt/c/Users/dspfa/Dev/platform-tools/adb.exe -H localhost -P 5037 -s cfb7c9e3"
$ADB push aosp-shim.dex /data/local/tmp/westlake/
$ADB push aosp-libbinder-port/out/PackageServiceTest.dex /data/local/tmp/westlake/dex/
$ADB shell 'su -c "bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh test --bcp-shim --bcp-framework --test PackageServiceTest"'
```

Expected: PASS exit 0.  Any failure should provide a numbered exit
code that points at the step (see §38.7).

### 38.10 Discovery hits not yet observed (anti-pattern guard)

Per the M4c brief's "no speculation beyond Tier-1" rule, every method
outside the 15 Tier-1 set throws `ServiceMethodMissing.fail`.  Once
M4-PRE14's DisplayAdjustments lands and discovery resumes past
PHASE G4, expect Hilt-internal calls to surface new Tier-1
candidates — promote them one at a time per the
`docs/engine/AGENT_SWARM_PLAYBOOK.md` Tier-1 promotion procedure.

### 38.11 Anti-pattern audit

* No per-app branches: `mPackageName` is read from
  `westlake.apk.package` system property at construction; works for
  noice, mock apps, future real APKs.
* No `Unsafe.allocateInstance` on the Stub: uses the supported
  `Stub(PermissionEnforcer)` ctor with a `NoopPermissionEnforcer`.
* `WestlakePackageManagerService` does NOT extend, wrap, or replace
  M4-PRE5's `WestlakePackageManagerStub` — they answer different
  caller paths and coexist cleanly.
* Tier-1 set strictly matches the M4c brief; no speculative impls
  outside that 15-method window.

## 39. CR12 — Binder topology diagnostic (post-reboot) — 2026-05-12

### 39.1 Trigger and headline

Earlier session probes appeared to show three binder devices
(`/dev/binder` + `/dev/vndbinder` + `/dev/hwbinder`); a post-reboot
probe today appeared to show only `/dev/binder` + a new empty
`/dev/binderfs/` directory. The CR12 brief speculated three causes:
(1) kernel upgrade, (2) LineageOS binderfs backport, (3) inert
mount-point breadcrumb. **CR12 is purely diagnostic** — no code change,
no boot script edits.

**Result:** all three legacy binder devices remain present and
functional. The "missing devices" appearance was a **shell-glob
artifact**: `ls -la /dev/binder*` only matches names starting with
`binder` (matches `binder` and the `binderfs` directory; does NOT match
`hwbinder` or `vndbinder`). Direct probes
(`ls -la /dev/binder /dev/hwbinder /dev/vndbinder`) confirm all three
char devices are alive, mode 0666, with their canonical SELinux
contexts. Live `servicemanager` / `hwservicemanager` /
`vndservicemanager` processes hold open file descriptors on the
respective device nodes, exactly as on previous boots.

### 39.2 Kernel + config evidence

* `uname -r`: `4.9.337-g2e921a892c03` (unchanged from memory; kernel was
  NOT upgraded).
* `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_IPC=y`, `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES=
  "binder,hwbinder,vndbinder"` (unchanged).
* `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDERFS`: **absent** — binderfs is NOT supported on
  this kernel.
* `/proc/filesystems` does not list `binder`; `mount -t binder ...`
  returns `ENODEV`.
* The `/dev/binderfs/` empty directory is a breadcrumb left by
  LineageOS's `/system/etc/init/hw/init.rc` (which contains an
  unconditional `# Mount binderfs` block); the `mkdir` half succeeds,
  the `mount binder binder /dev/binderfs` half silently fails. The
  intended symlinks (`/dev/binder` → `/dev/binderfs/binder`, etc.) also
  fail because their targets don't exist; the legacy char devices
  remain as the canonical nodes.

### 39.3 Implication for boot scripts

**Zero change** to `sandbox-boot.sh`, `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh`,
`noice-discover.sh`, or `lib-boot.sh` is required. The
`/dev/vndbinder` substrate that all three rely on is intact and CR7's
synchronous-stop logic continues to apply. Per AGENT_SWARM_PLAYBOOK
§6.7 ("don't touch a working reference"), we do **not** preemptively
land a binderfs detection arm in the boot scripts; that would be
churn risk on a working path. A forward-port note for Phase 2 (when
moving to a 5.x+ kernel that DOES support binderfs) is documented in
`aosp-libbinder-port/diagnostics/CR12_binder_topology_report.md` §10.

### 39.4 Phone-disconnect symptom (out of scope for CR12)

The "phone keeps disconnecting" observation in the brief is unrelated
to binder topology — the kernel binder substrate is healthy and three
context managers are running. The disconnect cause is most likely
upstream (Windows adb host / USB driver / Magisk's adbd patch /
LineageOS adbd boot ordering); diagnosing it is **not** in CR12's
diagnostic scope and lives elsewhere.

### 39.5 LOC delta

* `aosp-libbinder-port/diagnostics/CR12_binder_topology_report.md` —
  new file, ~530 LOC (full diagnostic + path-forward proposals + repro
  recipe).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` — this §39, ~80 LOC.
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` — one row added to the §1.3 table.
* No source code, boot scripts, or framework shim files touched.

### 39.6 Anti-pattern audit

* Diagnostic-only: no code, no boot scripts, no `aosp-src/`,
  no `art-latest/`.
* No speculation: every claim in the report is anchored to a probe
  command transcript (kernel config grep, ls output, mount attempt,
  /proc/filesystems, process fd table, SELinux context).
* No `Unsafe.allocateInstance` or similar bypass tooling; this is a
  read-only milestone.
* No per-app branches anywhere (CR12 is OS-level, not app-level).

### 39.7 Cross-references

* Full diagnostic + path-forward proposals + repro recipe:
  `aosp-libbinder-port/diagnostics/CR12_binder_topology_report.md`
  (deliverable for this milestone).
* Boot scripts referenced (unchanged):
  `aosp-libbinder-port/sandbox-boot.sh` /
  `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh` /
  `test/noice-discover.sh` /
  `lib-boot.sh`.
* Phase-2 binderfs migration sketch:
  `CR12_binder_topology_report.md` §10.

## 40. CR11 — Parcel receive-side accepts any canonical kHeader (2026-05-12)

### 40.1 Trigger and headline

After the OnePlus 6 reboot diagnosed in §39 (CR12), the phone's
`vndservicemanager` resumed using the `'VNDR'` 4-byte transaction header
on its replies. Our libbinder, baked with `WESTLAKE_KHEADER_SYST=1` from
CR6 (patch 0003), rejected every transaction with:

```
E Parcel: Expecting header 0x53595354 but found 0x564e4452.
                                                Mixing copies of libbinder?
```

`noice-discover-sm.log` accumulated 177 KB of those errors before the
harness gave up. `dalvikvm` made zero progress past PHASE A; not one
binder service handle was acquired.

The send-side patch from CR6 (patch 0003) is necessary but not sufficient:
it controls only what *we* write. The receive-side equality check
`if (header != kHeader) reject` rejects anything peers write with a
different magic — which is the common case on a real device where
different partitions and different OHOS-vendor builds ship their own
`kHeader`.

### 40.2 Resolution — widen the receive-side comparison

Patch 0004 (`aosp-libbinder-port/patches/0004-parcel-accept-any-kheader-on-recv.patch`)
changes `Parcel::enforceInterface` from a single-value equality check to
a set-membership check over the four canonical AOSP magic values:

```cpp
// CR11 (2026-05-12): widen the receive-side comparison.
constexpr int32_t kHeaderSYST = B_PACK_CHARS('S','Y','S','T');
constexpr int32_t kHeaderVNDR = B_PACK_CHARS('V','N','D','R');
constexpr int32_t kHeaderRECO = B_PACK_CHARS('R','E','C','O');
constexpr int32_t kHeaderUNKN = B_PACK_CHARS('U','N','K','N');
const bool headerAccepted = (header == kHeaderSYST) ||
                            (header == kHeaderVNDR) ||
                            (header == kHeaderRECO) ||
                            (header == kHeaderUNKN);
if (!headerAccepted && !mServiceFuzzing) {
    ALOGE("Expecting header 0x%x but found 0x%x. Mixing copies of libbinder?",
          kHeader, header);
    return false;
}
```

The send side is unchanged — we still write our `kHeader` so peers can
identify us as a Westlake/AOSP-shim caller. The four-byte magic remains
a useful self-identifying breadcrumb in logs and crash reports, but is
no longer a gate.

### 40.3 Send/receive asymmetry — why both sides need different rules

| Side | Function | Behavior | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Send | `writeInterfaceToken` (Parcel.cpp:1001) | Writes our `kHeader` (`'SYST'` today via `WESTLAKE_KHEADER_SYST=1`) | Peer can identify us in logs. |
| Receive | `enforceInterface` (Parcel.cpp:1114) | Accepts `'SYST' \| 'VNDR' \| 'RECO' \| 'UNKN'` | Cross-partition / cross-vendor interop. |

This mirrors AOSP's own behavior across partitions at the kernel-binder
layer: `system_server` happily accepts traffic from vendor processes (and
vice versa). The partition split is enforced higher up via SELinux and
service-name registration, not via this magic.

### 40.4 What landed

* `aosp-libbinder-port/aosp-src/libbinder/Parcel.cpp` — receive-side
  comparison widened (lines ~1085-1118).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/patches/0004-parcel-accept-any-kheader-on-recv.patch`
  — new patch file documenting the change (idempotent: forward-apply and
  reverse-apply both safe on the patched source).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/README.md` — Patches section updated (six patches
  now), per-patch entry added.
* `docs/engine/BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN.md` §5.8 — asymmetry note appended.
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` — this §40.
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` — CR11 row added to milestones table.

### 40.5 Build verification

Rebuilt all three libbinder artifacts plus the statically-linked
`dalvikvm`:

```
$ ls -la aosp-libbinder-port/out/bionic/libbinder.so \
         aosp-libbinder-port/out/bionic/libbinder_full_static.a \
         aosp-libbinder-port/out/libbinder.so \
         $HOME/art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm
-rwxr-xr-x  1.7M  ... out/bionic/libbinder.so
-rw-r--r--  2.6M  ... out/bionic/libbinder_full_static.a
-rwxr-xr-x  803K  ... out/libbinder.so
-rwxr-xr-x   27M  ... art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm
```

Sizes vs. pre-CR11: musl libbinder.so +80 bytes (`803K -> 803K`), bionic
libbinder.so +80 bytes (`1.7M -> 1.7M`), libbinder_full_static.a +72
bytes, dalvikvm +136 bytes. The deltas are the constexpr-folded
four-value comparison vs. the original one-value comparison.

The "Mixing copies of libbinder?" error string is still present in
every binary — it's the error message *when no header in the accepted
set is matched*, not removed.

### 40.6 On-device test

```
$ adb -s cfb7c9e3 push out/bionic/libbinder.so      /data/local/tmp/westlake/lib-bionic/
$ adb -s cfb7c9e3 push out/bionic/servicemanager    /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/
$ adb -s cfb7c9e3 push art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm \
                                                    /data/local/tmp/westlake/dalvikvm
$ adb -s cfb7c9e3 push art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm \
                                                    /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/dalvikvm
$ adb -s cfb7c9e3 shell 'chmod 0755 <each path above>'
$ adb -s cfb7c9e3 shell 'su -c "bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/noice-discover.sh"' \
   > /tmp/discover-postCR11.log
```

Result:

* **Zero** `Mixing copies of libbinder` lines in `noice-discover.log` or
  `noice-discover-sm.log` (vs. 177 KB pre-CR11).
* `noice-discover-sm.log` reduced to a single line:
  `I ?: Starting sm instance on /dev/vndbinder` — the SM never rejected
  a transaction.
* **PHASE A completed**: 70 service probes, 4 hits (our local
  `package`/`window`/`power`/etc. services registered via
  `WestlakeService*Service`), 66 misses (the SM legitimately doesn't
  hold handles for remote services like `SurfaceFlinger`,
  `jobscheduler`, etc. — that's expected because we own the SM
  context-manager slot during the test).
* **PHASE B reached**: noice's APK loader was invoked and got far
  enough to call `ZipArchive::Find(classes2.dex)` (failed for an
  unrelated multi-dex reason — separate ticket).

The CR11 fix is verified working: SYST/VNDR mismatch is gone, the
header-magic gate no longer blocks any traffic.

### 40.7 LOC delta

* `aosp-libbinder-port/aosp-src/libbinder/Parcel.cpp` — +28 / -2.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/patches/0004-parcel-accept-any-kheader-on-recv.patch`
  — new file, ~85 LOC (patch body + doc).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/README.md` — +30 / -1 (new patch entry; total
  count updated).
* `docs/engine/BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN.md` §5.8 — +14 LOC (asymmetry note).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` — this §40, ~150 LOC.
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` — one row added to CR table.

No source code outside Parcel.cpp touched. No boot scripts, no
framework shim files, no per-app branches.

### 40.8 Anti-pattern audit

* No per-app branches.
* No `Unsafe.allocateInstance` or reflection.
* No new shim layer — surgical change inside the same `enforceInterface`
  body the AOSP source already has.
* Patch 0003 (send-side SYST/VNDR/UNKN selector) is preserved
  unchanged; we did NOT remove SYST as the default because the send
  side still needs it for peer recognition.
* No rate-limit / sleep / retry workarounds — the bug was a categorical
  rejection, not a transient timing issue.

### 40.9 Cross-references

* Send-side selector: §5.8 of BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN.md and CR6 patch
  `aosp-libbinder-port/patches/0003-parcel-kheader-syst.patch`.
* Diagnostic predecessor (post-reboot binder topology audit): §39 of
  this file (CR12).
* Phase-1 milestones table: `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md`.
* Post-fix discovery transcript: `/tmp/discover-postCR11.log` (host)
  and `/data/local/tmp/westlake/noice-discover.log` (phone, until next
  test run overwrites it).

## 41. CR14 — WestlakeLauncher.java slim (execute C4 audit `[DELETE-after-M4]` dispositions) — 2026-05-12

**Brief:** Execute the deletions tagged `[DELETE-after-M4]` in
`docs/engine/WESTLAKE_LAUNCHER_AUDIT.md` (the C4 audit). The launcher
had accumulated ~10,800 LOC of per-app McD code, experiment-only
cutoff-canary paths, and Hilt fragment seeding mirrors that were
unblocked by M4a/b/c/d/e/power.

### 41.1 Sections processed (17 of 21 `[DELETE-after-M4]`)

**Fully deleted (no external callers found after audit verification):**

* **S43** (`renderRealIconsScreen` + `newPaint`, lines 22906-22982, ~77 LOC) — experiment-time control-android drawable probe.
* **S42** (`injectDashboardContent` + `findLinearLayouts` + `addSectionHeader` + `addMenuItem`, lines 22706-22904, ~199 LOC) — per-McD-app hardcoded 5-section dashboard injector.
* **S28** (Generic reflection helpers: `invokePublicOneArg`, `getFragmentFieldReflective`, `invokeFragmentTransactionReplace`, etc., 21 methods totalling ~461 LOC) — verified zero external callers after S26 deletion.
* **S21** (`launchMcdProfileControlledActivity` + `setActivityFieldReflective` + 3 Activity lifecycle reflection helpers, lines 8334-8514, ~181 LOC) plus the 7-line `mainImpl` branch (S14 lines 4692-4698) that invoked it.
* **S18** (`buildRealSplashUI` + `buildMcDonaldsUI`, lines 5551-5804, ~254 LOC) — verified zero callers anywhere.
* **S6** (Cutoff canary launch path: `launchCutoffCanaryStandalone`, `launchCutoffCanaryViaWat`, manifest scanning helpers — `cutoffCanaryManifestPath`, `cutoffCanaryManifestFactoryClassName`, `cutoffCanaryManifestApplicationClassName`, `scanManifestForAppComponentFactory`, `selectAppComponentFactoryCandidate`, ~287 LOC) — replaced with single false-returning stub since mainImpl S14 still has the guarded `if (launchCutoffCanaryStandalone(...))` callsites.

**Body replaced with no-op stubs (external API preserved):**

* **S38+S39+S40** (McD PDP stock-button click + RxJava+LiveData re-implementation + RealmList seeding, lines 19715-22122, ~2408 LOC) — replaced with 6 entry-point stubs (`performMcdPdpTargetClick`, `performMcdPdpStockButtonClick`, `mcdPdpFragmentDepsReady`, `readMcdPdpFragmentField`, `readMcdBindingRoot`, `findMcdOrderPdpFragment`) all returning false/null. S25/S26/S37 ([DELETE-after-M6]) still call these.
* **S27** (McD Glide / SDK seeding, lines 13196-13594, ~400 LOC) — replaced with 7 entry-point stubs (`ensureMcdGlideRequestManagerStarted`, `ensureMcdCoreManagerParams`, `ensureMcdAppConfigurationNumberFormat`, `buildMcdPopularSeedList`, `buildMcdPromotionSeedList`, `prefetchMcdPopularSeedImages`, `prefetchMcdImageUrl`).
* **S26** (Decor / layout normalization, two ranges totaling ~2095 LOC: first range 8889-10354 with `layoutShowcaseDecor`/`layoutMcdProfileDecor`/`prepareMcdPdpForStrictFrame`/etc.; second range 10847-11475 with `mcdSectionHasContent`/`layoutMcdDashboardStrictFrame`/etc.) — replaced with 15 entry-point stubs. The pre-existing `ViewTreeDispatchStats` inner class (defined elsewhere in file) is now used only by callers from S25/S29/S33.
* **S19** (Dashboard scaffolding + Hilt fragment seeding, lines 5720-7753, ~2035 LOC) — replaced with 13 entry-point stubs (`findFieldOnHierarchy` and `findMethodOnHierarchy` kept as real reflection utilities since they're called from many `[DELETE-after-M6]` sections; rest as no-ops).
* **S20** partial: 5 McD-specific methods (`routeDashboardFallbackTouch`, `updateMcdStartOrderButton`, `installDashboardViewFallback`, `ensureMcdDashboardXmlScaffold`, `drawTextOnlyDashboardMenu`) had bodies reduced to no-op stubs (~440 LOC body removed). The shared helpers (`safeFindViewById`, `safeDensity`, `findTextViewWithText`, `isDashboardFallbackInstalled`, `markDashboardFallbackInstalled`, `shouldUseTextOnlyDashboardMenu`) **retained** with full bodies — they're called from many non-S20 sites.
* **S34** (`tryEmitNoiceFallbackFrame` + `runStrictStandaloneMainLoop` + `shouldForceMcdDashboardAfterSplash` + `shouldDeferMcdDashboardResumeForFirstFrame` + `startDeferredMcdDashboardResume` + `isMcdonaldsSplashActivity`, lines 18920-19103, ~184 LOC) — replaced with 5 entry-point stubs since S11/S14/S33 still call them.
* **S32** body (`populateDashboardFallback`, ~64 LOC) — replaced with no-op stub since WestlakeInstrumentation.java still calls it.
* **S36** bodies (`recordMcdOrderNavigation`, `recordMcdCategoryNavigation`, ~8 LOC) — bodies stubbed since LayoutInflater still calls them.

### 41.2 Sections deliberately NOT deleted

* **S15** (McD application/context pre-seeding inside `mainImpl`, lines 4133-4232, ~100 LOC) — the audit warns "only DELETE if the M4a/M4-PRE patches truly satisfy what S15 was doing"; current bootstrap relies on the McD onCreate threading + timeout workaround. Deferred to a follow-up CR with M4a bootstrap-path validation.
* **S16** (Cutoff canary blocks inside `mainImpl`, ~110 LOC across 5 callsites) — even with S6 stubbed to return false, the guards (`if (cutoffCanaryLaunch)`) still execute through mainImpl logic. Surgical removal is risky for the same reason as S15; deferred to a follow-up CR.
* **S3** (Framework policy resolution methods: `isRealFrameworkFallbackAllowed`, `frameworkPolicyValue`, `backendModeValue`, `isControlAndroidBackend`, ~170 LOC) — **30+ external callers** across `shim/java/android/{view/Window,view/LayoutInflater,view/View,view/ViewGroup,content/Context,app/MiniActivityManager,app/ApkLoader,app/Activity,app/WestlakeInstrumentation,app/WestlakeActivityThread,app/AppComponentFactory}.java`; **NOT-TO-TOUCH per task** scope. Bodies retained intact.
* **S12** (HTTP bridge + McD menu fetcher, ~850 LOC) — `mcdLiveAdapterImageBytes` is called from `LayoutInflater.java`; `bridgeHttpGetBytes` is part of the public-API surface used by the McD app at runtime. Cannot be cleanly deleted without simultaneously editing LayoutInflater (out of scope).

### 41.3 Second pass — orphan cleanup

After the section deletions, several methods I had stubbed for downstream callers were themselves no longer referenced (because their last internal callers had been stubbed). A two-iteration orphan sweep removed:

* **38 orphan methods** including stub remnants of S19 (`buildProgrammaticDashboardFallbackRoot`, `findDashboardFragmentInstance`, `seedHiltFragmentContext`, etc.), S20 stubs (`installDashboardViewFallback`, `drawTextOnlyDashboardMenu`, `markDashboardFallbackInstalled`, `shouldUseTextOnlyDashboardMenu`, `updateMcdStartOrderButton`), S27 stubs (`ensureMcdGlideRequestManagerStarted`, `ensureMcdCoreManagerParams`, etc.), an isolated `buildLaunchIntent` from S11 that became dead, and dalvikvm bug workarounds that are no longer needed (`tryUnsafeEnsureClassInitialized`, `logDashboardOwnershipOnce`, `logDashboardInstallProbe`).
* **29 orphan static fields** including 9 `sMcd*` counter ints, 6 `sView*Field` java.lang.reflect.Field caches for the deleted View.mLeft/mTop/mRight/mBottom anti-pattern, the `MCD_*_PROP` config constants, `MCD_OFFLINE_MAX_QTTY_ALLOWED_PER_ORDER`, `MCD_POPULAR_SEED_IMAGE_NAME`, `MCD_DASHBOARD_SYNTHETIC_FALLBACK_PROP`, `CUTOFF_CANARY_APPLICATION`, `CUTOFF_CANARY_L4_HILT_ACTIVITY`, and 7 dashboard fallback counters.

### 41.4 LOC + dex deltas

| Metric | Before CR14 | After CR14 | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| WestlakeLauncher.java LOC | 22,983 | 13,528 | **-9,455 LOC (-41.1%)** |
| WestlakeLauncher method definitions | ~796 | ~448 | -348 methods |
| aosp-shim.dex bytes | 1,577,644 | 1,393,148 | **-184,496 bytes (-11.7%)** |

### 41.5 Verification

* **Build:** Clean (`scripts/build-shim-dex.sh` succeeds with zero errors; pre-existing warnings about McDListener / RequestProvider default interface methods are unchanged).
* **HelloBinder smoke test (M3 baseline)**: PASS on phone `cfb7c9e3` with new dex (`getService("westlake.test.echo")` returns non-null, exit code 0). No new regressions in the dex-load path.
* **McD smoke test**: confirmed dex loads correctly (no missing-method NoSuchMethodError class-loading failures). Full McD launch test not run (per task brief: "Don't run a fresh launch test — too time-consuming + phone-dependent").

### 41.6 Anti-pattern audit

* No new code added (this is pure deletion + entry-point stubs).
* No `[KEEP-but-shrink]` sections deleted (only `[DELETE-after-M4]` tagged content).
* No `[DELETE-after-M6]` sections deleted (M6 surface daemon not yet done; S29/S26/S25 still need their stubs to compile).
* No external shim files touched (the public API surface called from `shim/java/android/*` is preserved via entry-point stubs).
* No boot scripts touched.
* No service files touched.
* No per-app logic introduced (in fact removed ~6,000 LOC of per-McD-app reflection / hardcoded UI / per-McD-PDP click handlers).

### 41.7 Cross-references

* C4 audit document: `docs/engine/WESTLAKE_LAUNCHER_AUDIT.md` (the disposition source-of-truth).
* Prior cleanup milestones: C1 (WestlakeFragmentLifecycle, -3087 LOC), C2 (per-app constants from Fragment*, -340 LOC), C3 (DexLambdaScanner, -600 LOC). CR14 is the launcher counterpart.
* Follow-up: S15 + S16 still pending (~210 LOC inside `mainImpl`); deferred until M4a bootstrap-path validation can confirm the McD onCreate threading workaround is no longer required.

## 42. CR13 — PHASE B SIGBUS diagnostic (post-reboot recurrence) — 2026-05-12

### 42.1 Headline

Post-reboot on `cfb7c9e3`, `noice-discover.sh` reproducibly SIGBUSes at
PHASE B with **fault addr `0xfffffffffffffb17`** — the Westlake
`kPFCutStaleNativeEntry` sentinel (PF-arch-053 family). The PFCUT-SIGNAL
output attributes the top frame to `BaseDexClassLoader.toString()` but
the **actual crashing control flow is inside `new
PathClassLoader(noice.apk, ...)` ctor**, before `noicePCL` is assigned
and well before line 326's `println("PHASE B: PathClassLoader created:
" + noicePCL)` ever executes.

The crash is **shape-specific to `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex`** — five
reproducers (PclProbe, V2, V3, V5, V6) built on the same dalvikvm /
BCP / ServiceRegistrar register-count / 70-probe loop ALL pass with
exit 0; only the literal `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex` SIGBUSes.

**Substrate is healthy**: HelloBinder, AsInterfaceTest, and all three
modes of `bcp-sigbus-repro.sh` PASS on the same hardware in the same
session window.

**Recommended Tier-2 fix** (NOT applied here per "FILES NOT TO TOUCH:
`art-latest/*`") is a 2-line widen-the-null-guard patch to
`art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc:2750-2757`:

```cpp
// Pre-fix (vulnerable):
if (fns->NewStringUTF == nullptr) return nullptr;
return fns->NewStringUTF(env, "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]");

// Post-fix (queued as CR14-class follow-up):
constexpr uintptr_t kPFCutStaleNativeEntry = 0xfffffffffffffb17ULL;
const void* upcall = reinterpret_cast<const void*>(fns->NewStringUTF);
if (upcall == nullptr ||
    reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(upcall) == kPFCutStaleNativeEntry) {
  return nullptr;
}
return fns->NewStringUTF(env, "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]");
```

### 42.2 Hypothesis disproof tally

| H | Description | Status | Probe |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Stale dalvik-cache (`/data/local/tmp/westlake/arm64/*` from 2026-04-20) | DISPROVED | `rm -rf` + re-run → same fault. Files NOT on standalone-mode dalvikvm load path. |
| H2 | SELinux re-enforcing | DISPROVED | `getenforce` reports `Permissive`. No SELinux denials in `dmesg | grep avc:`. |
| H3 | ASLR layout sensitivity | DISPROVED | `echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` + re-run → same fault. |
| H4 | adbd state | N/A | We run via `su`. dalvikvm child is reparented to `init`. |
| H5 | framework.jar mmap conflict | unlikely | md5 matches; mmap fallback succeeded (`zip good scan 1245 entries` printed). |
| H6 | Magisk hot-patching | unverifiable | dalvikvm md5 unchanged from host build. |
| H7 | ServiceRegistrar class init poisons ART | DISPROVED | V5/V6 reproducers force identical 4/7 ServiceRegistrar bringup + PHASE A 70-probe and PASS. |
| H8 | Patched `loader_to_string` lambda's null-guard admits the sentinel | CONFIRMED (proximate cause) | Disassembly: `cbz x2` at `0x6744c4` only tests zero; sentinel `0xfffffffffffffb17 ≠ 0` falls through to `br x2`. |
| H9 | `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex`-shape dependent | CONFIRMED | Only NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex (with its 30 KB / ~25-method class-link footprint pulling in dozens of framework class refs) reproduces. |

### 42.3 Bytecode of the offending call

`art_quick_generic_jni_trampoline` at `0xd8f400` → `blr x16` at
`0xd8f490` → `$_64::__invoke` (patched `loader_to_string` lambda) at
`0x6744b4`:

```
6744b4: cbz  x0, .ret_null
6744b8: ldr  x8, [x0]               ; x8 = JNIEnv::functions
6744bc: cbz  x8, .ret_null
6744c0: ldr  x2, [x8, #1336]         ; x2 = fns->NewStringUTF (sentinel!)
6744c4: cbz  x2, .ret_null           ; passes — sentinel ≠ 0
6744c8: adrp x1, 0x26f000
6744cc: add  x1, x1, #3776           ; x1 = "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]"
6744d0: br   x2                      ; BRANCH TO 0xfffffffffffffb17 → BUS_ADRALN
```

Offset 1336 / 8 = 167 indexes `JNINativeInterface::NewStringUTF`
(confirmed by counting entries in
`aosp-android-11/libnativehelper/include_jni/jni.h`: 4 reserved slots +
163rd named function from `GetVersion`).

The static `gJniNativeInterface` table at vaddr `0xfad3c0` has the
**correct** function pointer (verified at file offset `0xdab8f8` —
points near `0x6a5834` which resolves to a normal NewStringUTF impl).
So the sentinel is overlaid at runtime; we have NOT located the write
site. (CR15-class investigation.)

### 42.4 Two-faces-of-same-bug — M4-PRE14 fault `0x6f6874656d2063` vs CR13 fault `0xfffffffffffffb17`

M4-PRE14's report had PC = `0x6f6874656d2063` (ASCII `"c method "`).
Today's PC = `0xfffffffffffffb17` (the sentinel literal). Same x16
value (`0x6744b4` = `$_64::__invoke`), same JNI lambda, same patched
`BaseDexClassLoader.toString` call. The ASCII variant is the
"uninitialized-memory-as-function-pointer" mode where some earlier
log-line buffer leaked into the JNI slot; the sentinel variant is
ART's deliberate write of `0xfffffffffffffb17` into the slot. Both are
downstream of the same proximate cause (insufficient guard in the
patched lambda) and the same upstream cause (unknown writer of the
sentinel into the function table). Confirms M4-PRE14's revert-test
conclusion: the M4-PRE14 DEX change is not the trigger.

### 42.5 Why M4-PRE13 succeeded earlier but the same DEX fails now

Per M4-PRE14's `revert-test`: pushing the byte-identical M4-PRE13 DEX
(matching md5) back to the device today STILL SIGBUSes. Therefore the
DEX content is not the differentiator. The most plausible explanation
(see CR13 report §2.5) is that the kernel-side physical-memory state
backing dalvikvm's mmap allocations is different post-reboot
(different page colouring, different page table state), and AOSP's
extract-fallback for the non-zipaligned noice.apk classes.dex triggers
a runtime path that exposes the upstream JNI-table-corruption bug.
Our V5/V6 reproducers exhibit the SAME dalvikvm runtime state up to
`new PathClassLoader(noice.apk, ...)` but their post-load class-link
graph is shallower (no `phaseG_mainActivityLaunch`/reflective Activity
scaffolding) so the corruption path is not triggered.

### 42.6 Reproducer matrix

| Test | Description | Result |
|---|---|---|
| HelloBinder.dex | M3 baseline | PASS |
| AsInterfaceTest.dex | M3+ baseline | PASS |
| `bcp-sigbus-repro.sh --bcp-shim --bcp-framework` | PF-arch-053 acceptance gate | PASS |
| PclProbe.dex | `new PathClassLoader(noice.apk)` + `pcl.toString()` | PASS (toString returns literal `null`) |
| PclProbeV2.dex | PclProbe + 4 service probes | PASS |
| PclProbeV3.dex | PclProbe + 13-service PHASE A-lite | PASS |
| V5.dex | + full CharsetPrimer + primeActivityThread + ServiceRegistrar (4/7) + 4 probes + PHASE B | PASS |
| V6.dex | + ALL 64 of NoiceDiscoverWrapper's PROBE_SERVICES + PHASE B | PASS |
| **NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex** | full discovery harness | **SIGBUS** at `0xfffffffffffffb17` (3/3 fresh-reboot runs) |

### 42.7 Files

* `aosp-libbinder-port/diagnostics/CR13_phaseB_sigbus_report.md` (NEW, ~430 LOC)
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this §42 + §0 index row added)
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (CR13 row added)

### 42.8 Files NOT touched

Per the brief's anti-pattern list:
* `art-latest/*` (would require rebuild + redeploy of dalvikvm)
* `aosp-libbinder-port/aosp-src/*` (CR11 substrate stable)
* `shim/java/*`
* `aosp-libbinder-port/out/*` and `aosp-libbinder-port/native/*`
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover.sh` (no verified fix to apply)
* `aosp-libbinder-port/m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh`

### 42.9 Next agent recipe

Three options for follow-up:

1. **Cosmetic** (~5 min): rebuild `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex` with
   line 326's `+ noicePCL` removed. Won't address root cause but
   removes one stack-walking artifact.
2. **Tier-2** (~20 min): apply the 2-line `loader_to_string` guard
   widen from §42.1 to `art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc`.
   Rebuild dalvikvm, redeploy. Verify all three modes of
   `bcp-sigbus-repro.sh` still PASS. CR14-class.
2. **Tier-3 investigation** (~2-4 hr): set a hardware watchpoint on
   the JNI function table's NewStringUTF slot (vaddr-dependent per
   ASLR) and trace WHO writes the sentinel. Likely culprit ranges
   per §5.9 of the diagnostic: `JNIEnvExt::SetTableOverride`,
   CheckJNI table init, or RuntimeOption Image resolution. CR15-class.

### 42.10 Person-time

~75 min (within the brief's 60-90 min budget).

## 43. CR16 — WestlakeLauncher.java migrate CR14-deferred sections (S3, S12, S15, S16) — 2026-05-12

**Brief:** CR14 left ~2K LOC of code undeleted across 4 sections (S3, S12,
S15, S16) because their entry methods are called from 30+ external shim
files. CR16 migrates each: entry methods kept as no-op-default stubs (API
preserved), implementations and orphan helpers/state/constants deleted.

### 43.1 Sections processed

| § | Section | Before | CR16 disposition | LOC delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S3 | Framework policy / backend mode resolution | `[DEFERRED-CR14]` | **`[STUBBED-CR16]`** — 4 entry methods stubbed; orphan helpers + caching state deleted | ~-105 |
| S12 | HTTP bridge + McD live image / menu JSON | `[DEFERRED-CR14]` | **`[STUBBED-CR16]`** — 6 entry methods stubbed; bridge HTTP helpers + state deleted; JSON menu helpers kept for [DELETE-after-M6] callers | ~-380 |
| S15 | McD application/context pre-seeding (mainImpl) | `[DEFERRED-CR14]` | **`[DONE-CR16]`** — McD-specific pre-seeding call and onCreate-deferred branch deleted; threaded onCreate kept (generic) | ~-25 |
| S16 | Cutoff canary in mainImpl branches | `[DEFERRED-CR14]` | **`[DONE-CR16]`** — 13 dispersed mainImpl branches deleted; 11 helper methods + 1 native decl + 1 state field + 3 constants deleted | ~-350 |
| **Total** | | | | **~-860 LOC** |

### 43.2 Stub defaults

S3: `frameworkPolicyValue()` → `"westlake_only"`,
`isRealFrameworkFallbackAllowed()` → `false`, `backendModeValue()` →
`"strict"`, `isControlAndroidBackend()` → `false`. All external callers
take the form `if (X) { control-android path; } else { strict-westlake
path; }` — with stubs returning `false`/`"westlake_only"`, the
strict-westlake path is the only path, which IS the M4 path.

S12: `bridgeHttpGetBytes(...)` → `null`, `bridgeHttpRequest(...)` →
`BridgeHttpResponse(0, "{}", new byte[0], "missing_bridge_dir", false,
url)`, `mcdLiveAdapter*` → `null` / fallback. External callers
(`WestlakeHttpTransport`, `McDHttpClient`, `McDRequestManager`,
`LayoutInflater`) tolerate null/error responses defensively.

S15: just delete the call sites — M4a + WestlakeContextImpl handle
McD-app onCreate via the regular lifecycle now.

S16: every dead `if (cutoffCanaryLaunch)` branch was either pure marker
logging (deleted) or set canary-package-specific overrides on locals
that the strict-westlake fallthrough already handled (deleted).

### 43.3 LOC + dex deltas

| Metric | Pre-CR16 (post-CR14) | Post-CR16 | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| WestlakeLauncher.java LOC | 13,528 | 12,668 | **-860 LOC (-6.4%)** |
| aosp-shim.dex bytes | 1,393,148 | 1,380,264 | **-12,884 bytes (-0.93%)** |

Cumulative CR14 + CR16 vs original (22,983 LOC, 1,577,644 bytes):
**-10,315 LOC (-44.9%)** and **-197,380 bytes (-12.5%)**.

### 43.4 Verification

- **Build:** Clean. No new warnings beyond the pre-existing
  McDListener/RequestProvider default-interface-method notes.
- **HelloBinder smoke test (M3 baseline)**: **PASS** on phone
  `cfb7c9e3` with the new dex. `getService("westlake.test.echo")`
  returns non-null `NativeBinderProxy{...}`, exit code 0.
- **AsInterfaceTest**: **PASS** on phone `cfb7c9e3`.

### 43.5 Anti-pattern audit

- No per-app branches added.
- No external shim files modified (the public API surface called from
  `shim/java/android/*` and others is preserved via entry-point stubs).
- No boot scripts touched. No M4 service files touched. No
  art-latest/* touched (CR15 still in flight).
- This is pure deletion + entry-point stubs — no new functionality.

### 43.6 Person-time

## 44. CR15 — PF-arch-054 widen `loader_to_string` null-guard (2026-05-12)

**Brief:** apply the 2-line widen-the-guard fix CR13 recommended for the
`art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc:2750-2757` `loader_to_string` JNI
lambda — extend the null-guard so it also rejects the Westlake
`kPFCutStaleNativeEntry` sentinel (`0xfffffffffffffb17`). Rebuild
`dalvikvm`. Verify that `noice-discover.sh` advances past PHASE B.

### 44.1 The fix applied

Before (CR13's recipe):
```cpp
if (fns->NewStringUTF == nullptr) return nullptr;
return fns->NewStringUTF(env, "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]");
```

After (PF-arch-054):
```cpp
// PF-arch-054 (CR15): widen null-guard to also reject the
// kPFCutStaleNativeEntry sentinel 0xfffffffffffffb17.
constexpr uintptr_t kPFCutStaleNativeEntry = 0xfffffffffffffb17ULL;
if (fns->NewStringUTF == nullptr ||
    reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(fns->NewStringUTF) == kPFCutStaleNativeEntry) {
  return nullptr;
}
return fns->NewStringUTF(env, "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]");
```

The compiler emits the new check as `cmn x2, #1257` (compare-and-negate
with imm12 zero-extended to 64 bits; sentinel `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFB17` = `-0x4E9`
= `-1257`; `cmn x2, #1257` ≡ `x2 + 1257 == 0` ⇔ `x2 == sentinel`).

Disassembly of `$_64::__invoke` at `0x6744b4` post-fix:

```
6744b4: cbz  x0, .ret_null        ; null JNIEnv
6744b8: ldr  x8, [x0]             ; x8 = JNIEnv::functions
6744bc: cbz  x8, .ret_null        ; null table
6744c0: ldr  x2, [x8, #1336]      ; x2 = fns->NewStringUTF
6744c4: cmn  x2, #1257            ; <-- NEW: sentinel check
6744c8: b.eq .ret_null
6744cc: cbnz x2, .br_x2
6744d0: mov  x0, xzr               ; .ret_null (returns null)
6744d4: ret
6744d8: adrp x1, ...               ; .br_x2 (calls NewStringUTF)
6744dc: add  x1, x1, #3776
6744e0: br   x2
```

The fix is provably correct at the lambda's call site.

### 44.2 Build + deploy

| Artifact | Pre-fix | Post-fix | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm` | 28266144 B (md5 `7546afc6...`) | 28266072 B (md5 `807cf339...`) | -72 B |

Build clean (single `make -f Makefile.bionic-arm64 runtime + link-runtime` cycle, ~12 s). Pushed
to phone `cfb7c9e3` at both `/data/local/tmp/westlake/dalvikvm` and
`/data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/dalvikvm`.

### 44.3 Smoke baseline (preserved)

```
$ adb shell 'su -c "bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh"' | grep -E "PASS|FAIL|exit code"
[m3-boot] dalvikvm exit code: 0
HelloBinder: PASS
```

### 44.4 The big test — STILL FAILS

```
$ adb shell 'su -c "bash /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/noice-discover.sh"' > /tmp/discover-postCR15.log 2>&1
$ grep -E "fault addr|exit code|PHASE" /tmp/discover-postCR15.log
[noice-discover] dalvikvm exit code: 135       # = 128+7 = SIGBUS
=== PHASE B: classload noice from /data/local/tmp/westlake/com_github_ashutoshgngwr_noice.apk ===
Fatal signal 7 (SIGBUS), code 1 (BUS_ADRALN) fault addr 0xfffffffffffffb17
```

PHASE A still completes (70 probes, 4 hits, 66 misses). PHASE B still
SIGBUSes at the SAME fault addr, SAME signature, SAME x16=`0x6744b4`,
SAME `top_quick_method=BaseDexClassLoader.toString` — across 2/2
consecutive runs (`postCR15.log` and `postCR15-r2.log`). PHASE C / D /
E / F / G NOT reached.

Transcript at `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postCR15.log`.

### 44.5 What CR15 proves — CR13's hypothesis was wrong

The `loader_to_string` lambda at `0x6744b4` now provably cannot branch
to `br x2` with x2 = sentinel — disassembly shows `cmn x2, #1257; b.eq
.ret_null` is in the code, and `cmn` with `#1257` correctly matches
`0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFB17`. Yet the fault PC is identical to pre-fix.

Therefore: **the actual `br/blr` to the sentinel is happening at a
DIFFERENT code site**, not in this lambda. The PFCUT-SIGNAL handler's
`top_quick_method=BaseDexClassLoader.toString` claim is a
stack-walking artifact (CR13 §2.3 already noted this — but CR13 then
incorrectly fingered `loader_to_string` as the proximate cause despite
that note).

Corroborating evidence in the new fault registers:
* `x30 (LR) = 0x7bdfde97d0` — this is in `[vdso]` mapping (the
  per-process Linux vdso pages). A LR in vdso suggests the most recent
  `bl` was to a vdso syscall stub like `clock_gettime`. That's
  inconsistent with being mid-call inside a Java `toString` invocation
  via the JNI trampoline (where LR would be `0xd8f494` per the
  trampoline disassembly).
* `x2 = 0x7bc78abdd0` at fault — a stack address, NOT the sentinel.
  In the lambda's `br x2` path, x2 would have BEEN the sentinel at the
  moment of `br`, and stays that value at trap (`br` to unaligned PC
  traps without modifying x2). Yet x2 at trap is a stack address.
  Therefore the trapping instruction was NOT our lambda's `br x2`.

### 44.6 Where the real `br sentinel` lives

Disassembly grep shows ~15 unguarded sites with the same
`ldr x?, [x?, #1336]; br x?` pattern (`#1336` = offset of `NewStringUTF`
in `JNINativeInterface`). The lambda numbers / locations include:

* `0x4d1bf8` — `art::InvokeMain::$_13::__invoke` (= `nativeVmArg` in
  `dalvikvm.cc:1859`; calls `e->NewStringUTF(g_main_args[i].c_str())`).
* `0x674b58` — `art::Runtime::Start::$_68::__invoke` (= `empty_icu_path`
  in `runtime.cc:3138`; dead code unless `WESTLAKE_ENABLE_ICU_DATA_PATH_NATIVE`
  env var is set, which `noice-discover.sh` does NOT set).
* `0x7c64fc`, `0x7c6f40`, `0x7c6f54`, `0x7c6f88` — `art::VMRuntime_*`
  AOSP-internal native methods (e.g., `VMRuntime_classPath`).
* Multiple others in `art::` and AOSP framework natives.

Any of these — if reached during PathClassLoader's ctor /
DexFile.openDexFile / class linking — would hit BUS_ADRALN at the
sentinel if `JNINativeInterface::NewStringUTF` is sentinel-poisoned.

### 44.7 Open mystery still open: WHO writes the sentinel

CR13 §6.3 flagged this as "deeper investigation required."  None of
the art-latest sites that mention `0xfffffffffffffb17` (class_linker.cc:169,
art_method.cc:391, interpreter.cc:487, etc.) WRITE the value into a
`JNINativeInterface` table slot — they all READ-and-CHECK. The static
`gJniNativeInterface` table at vaddr `0xfad3c0` (file offset `0xdab8f8`)
has the correct `JNIImpl::NewStringUTF` pointer in the binary. Yet at
runtime the slot ends up holding the sentinel.

Most plausible CR17-class probes:
* **HW watchpoint** on the slot vaddr `0xfad8f8` (= `0xfad3c0 + 8*167`):
  `lldb -p $(pidof dalvikvm) -- 'watchpoint set address 0xfad8f8 -w write'`
  and re-run PHASE B until it traps on the write.
* **CheckJNI table substitution audit**: `JNIEnvExt::SetTableOverride`
  (mangled `_ZN3art9JNIEnvExt16SetTableOverrideEPK18JNINativeInterface`)
  — does anything call this with a sentinel-padded table during PHASE B?
* **RuntimeOption Image resolution**: stale boot.art swap (already
  disproved per CR13 H1, but worth re-checking with the watchpoint).

### 44.8 The fix is still architecturally correct (defense-in-depth)

PF-arch-054 widening `loader_to_string`'s guard is the right thing to
do regardless of CR15's null result — it prevents any future invocation
of this lambda from branching to a sentinel-poisoned slot. The lambda's
caller correctly handles a null return (Java sees null toString result
and falls through). This is the same defensive shape as
`quick_trampoline_entrypoints.cc:2108-2112` (which already widens its
own guard for the equivalent ArtMethod entry-point sentinel).

We keep the fix landed. The next investigator can build on it.

### 44.9 Anti-pattern audit

* No per-app branches added — the widen-the-guard applies to ALL
  `BaseDexClassLoader/PathClassLoader/DexPathList.toString` calls.
* Did NOT speculatively widen for OTHER sentinels — only the one
  CR13 identified (`kPFCutStaleNativeEntry` `0xfffffffffffffb17`).
* No skipped tests — HelloBinder smoke-tested; noice-discover run
  twice with full transcript captured.
* No boot scripts, shim/java/*, aosp-libbinder-port/aosp-src/*,
  or art-latest/* outside `runtime.cc` touched.

### 44.10 Files touched

* `art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc` (+7 / -2 LOC, lines
  2750-2767, widen-the-guard).
* `art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm` (rebuilt, -72 B; md5
  `7546afc6...` → `807cf339...`).
* `art-latest/patches/PF-arch-054-pfcut-sentinel-null-guard.patch`
  (NEW, ~110 LOC: documents the change + diff + rebuild + verification
  + CR15's null result + path-forward).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/noice-discover-postCR15.log` (NEW, SIGBUS
  transcript, 18.9 KB).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this §44 + section index row +
  WestlakeLauncher.java audit annotation kept stale per CR16
  ownership).
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (CR15 row added, headline updated).

### 44.11 Person-time

~45 min total (inside the 30-45 min budget). 5 min reading the CR13
report, 3 min applying the patch, 4 min rebuild/deploy, 5 min smoke +
big-test run, 20 min investigating why the fix didn't work
(disassembly confirms fix loaded; identifying that the actual crash is
elsewhere), 8 min documenting.

## 46. CR17 — Move PermissionEnforcer bypass into M4d/M4e production code (2026-05-12)

### 46.1 Finding (codex review #2 HIGH)

Codex's second review (`/tmp/codex-review-2-output.txt`) flagged that
`WestlakeDisplayManagerService` (M4d), `WestlakeNotificationManagerService`
(M4e-notification), and `WestlakeInputMethodManagerService` (M4e-input_method)
call the default `super()` in their constructors. In Android 16's
framework.jar, the no-arg `IXxxManager$Stub()` ctor expands to:

```java
this(PermissionEnforcer.fromContext(
        ActivityThread.currentActivityThread().getSystemContext()))
```

In the cold-boot Westlake sandbox, `ActivityThread.sCurrentActivityThread`
is null until something explicitly plants it, so
`currentActivityThread()` returns null and the chained `.getSystemContext()`
NPEs.

The four M4 service tests (DisplayServiceTest, NotificationServiceTest,
InputMethodServiceTest, SystemServiceRouteTest) avoided this NPE via
`CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread()` (added in CR10 — §37), which
Unsafe-allocates an ActivityThread, plants a synthetic
`BootstrapContext` on `mSystemContext`, and installs the whole thing as
`sCurrentActivityThread`. But the production code path —
`WestlakeLauncher` calling `ServiceRegistrar.registerAllServices()` to
register the M4 services on real-app boot — has no primer call. So the
three services NPE'd when registered in production.

M4a (Activity), M4b (Window), M4c (Package), and M4-power had already
worked around the same NPE since they were built: each uses a
`Stub(PermissionEnforcer)` ctor overload with a private nested
`NoopPermissionEnforcer extends PermissionEnforcer` whose protected
no-arg ctor sets `mContext=null` and returns. No system services
touched, no ActivityThread needed. CR17 applies that same pattern to
M4d and M4e.

### 46.2 Fix

For each of the three target service classes:

1. Add `import android.os.PermissionEnforcer;`
2. Add a private nested `NoopPermissionEnforcer extends PermissionEnforcer`
   with a protected no-arg ctor body that simply calls `super()`.
3. Change the ctor from `super()` to `super(new NoopPermissionEnforcer())`.

For each of the three matching shim AIDL Stubs
(`IDisplayManager.Stub`, `INotificationManager.Stub`,
`IInputMethodManager.Stub`):

4. Add a `public Stub(android.os.PermissionEnforcer enforcer) { attachInterface(this, DESCRIPTOR); }`
   ctor overload so compile-time resolution of `super(new NoopPermissionEnforcer())`
   succeeds. (At runtime the shim Stubs are stripped from
   `aosp-shim.dex` by `scripts/framework_duplicates.txt` and
   framework.jar's real Stub — which has the same overload — wins.)

### 46.3 Test-side consolidation

After the production-code fix, the test mains for
DisplayServiceTest, NotificationServiceTest, and InputMethodServiceTest
no longer need `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread()` — the service
constructs cleanly via the bypass. Verified by stripping the primer
call and re-running each test individually: all 3 PASS with exit 0.

SystemServiceRouteTest and NoiceDiscoverWrapper RETAIN the primer call
as defense-in-depth: empirically removing it from SystemServiceRouteTest
caused reproducible (3/3 runs) PF-arch-054 / `kPFCutStaleNativeEntry`
SIGBUS at PHASE B. The primer is warming additional ActivityThread or
ContextWrapper state that these heavier-weight harnesses transitively
depend on; that path is independent of the Stub-ctor NPE and continues
to need priming until the underlying PF-arch-054 root cause is fixed
(CR15 / hw-watchpoint on `0xfad8f8` follow-up).

The `CharsetPrimer.primeActivityThread()` Javadoc was updated to mark
it "partially superseded" and document the new defense-in-depth role.

### 46.4 Verification

Final regression suite (binder-pivot-regression.sh full):
**12 PASS / 1 FAIL / 0 SKIP** — same headline number as pre-CR17. The
1 FAIL is CR15's already-known noice-discover PF-arch-054 SIGBUS at
PHASE B, independent of this CR.

## 47. CR19 — `WestlakePackageManagerStub` fail-loud conversion (2026-05-12)

### 47.1 Finding source

Codex review #2 Tier 2 finding (verbatim):

> Because `Context.getPackageManager()` returns this local PM, it can
> bypass the newer binder-backed M4c service and silently steer app
> behavior.

The codex review noted that `WestlakePackageManagerStub.java`
(`shim/java/com/westlake/services/`, M4-PRE5, ~556 LOC) had been
created **before** CR2 established the fail-loud pattern. CR2
converted the binder-backed M4 service Stubs (M4a `IActivityManager`,
M4b `IWindowManager`, M4c `IPackageManager`, M4-power `IPowerManager`,
later M4d `IDisplayManager` / M4e `INotificationManager` /
`IInputMethodManager`) — but NOT this local `PackageManager` (which is
a different class hierarchy: extends `android.content.pm.PackageManager`
abstract class, not an `IPackageManager.Stub`).

The result: noice's Hilt-DI generated `attachBaseContext` reaches
`Context.getPackageManager()` and gets this local stub back; any
non-Tier-1 method call on it returned 0/null/false/empty **silently**,
which is exactly the "speculative completeness" smell §3.5 of the
agent-swarm playbook warns about.

### 47.2 What CR19 changed

`shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakePackageManagerStub.java`:

* Header comment block (lines 47-55): noted that 168 method bodies are
  now fail-loud throws, not silent safe-defaults.
* Section banner (lines ~387-407): retitled "CR19 FAIL-LOUD METHODS"
  with explanatory comment about how unchecked
  `UnsupportedOperationException` bypasses checked-exception
  declarations on methods like `installExistingPackage(String) throws
  NameNotFoundException` (the throws clause is irrelevant when the
  body throws an unchecked exception).
* Lines 410-577: **168 method bodies** rewritten from `{ return null; }`
  / `{ return false; }` / `{ return 0; }` / `{ return new T[0]; }`
  / `{  }` (for void) to
  `{ throw ServiceMethodMissing.fail("packageManager", "<methodName>"); }`.

### 47.3 Tier-1 methods preserved unchanged (11)

Per the codex review brief and M4-PRE5's original §18 list. None of
these methods were touched by CR19:

| Method                                          | Body behavior       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `getServiceInfo(ComponentName, int)`            | Synthetic populated `ServiceInfo` for our package; throws `NameNotFoundException` for foreign packages |
| `getActivityInfo(ComponentName, int)`           | Synthetic populated `ActivityInfo` for our package; throws `NameNotFoundException` for foreign packages |
| `getApplicationInfo(String, int)`               | Returns the cached `mApplicationInfo`; throws `NameNotFoundException` for foreign packages |
| `getPackageInfo(String, int)`                   | Populated `PackageInfo` for our package; throws `NameNotFoundException` for foreign packages |
| `hasSystemFeature(String)`                      | Returns `false` (safe default — no system features advertised) |
| `hasSystemFeature(String, int)`                 | Returns `false` (same) |
| `resolveActivity(Intent, int)`                  | Returns `null` (safe — no registered resolver) |
| `resolveService(Intent, int)`                   | Returns `null` (safe — no registered resolver) |
| `queryIntentActivities(Intent, int)`            | Returns empty `ArrayList` (safe) |
| `getInstalledPackages(int)`                     | Returns single-element list with our `PackageInfo` |
| `checkPermission(String, String)`               | Returns `PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED` (sandbox runs as system uid) |

### 47.4 Method count summary

| Bucket                                          | Pre-CR19 | Post-CR19 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Tier-1 real-impl methods                        | 11       | 11        |
| Non-Tier-1 silent stubs (return null/false/0/empty) | 168 | 0 |
| Non-Tier-1 fail-loud throws (`ServiceMethodMissing.fail`) | 0 | 168 |
| **Total method overrides**                      | **179**  | **179**   |

### 47.5 Build

```
$ bash scripts/build-shim-dex.sh
...
=== Done: aosp-shim.dex (1383652 bytes) ===
```

Size delta: **1,380,980 → 1,383,652 bytes (+2,672 B / +0.19%)**.

Wider bodies (`throw ServiceMethodMissing.fail(...)` with 25-30 char
method name strings) cost slightly more DEX bytes than 0/null/false
returns, but the per-method overhead is small because all 168 bodies
share the same `invoke-static` to `ServiceMethodMissing.fail` and
`throw` opcode pair; only the string constant pool grows by 168 new
method-name string IDs.

### 47.6 Verification

**Acceptance criteria from the brief**:

1. *All previously-passing tests still pass* — partially confirmed
   (see flakiness note below); zero failures were correlated with
   PackageManager methods or carried the `WestlakeServiceMethodMissing`
   marker.
2. *Any new UnsupportedOperationException firings reveal previously-
   hidden silent calls* — none observed in the 5 regression runs;
   `grep WestlakeServiceMethodMissing /tmp/cr19-quick.log` returned
   zero hits.

**Regression suite flakiness on cfb7c9e3** (5 quick runs post-CR19;
each `bash scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh --quick`):

| Run | Failed tests | Notes |
| --- | ------------ | ----- |
| 1   | `SystemServiceRouteTest` (exit 1 — servicemanager died on startup) | infra: vndservicemanager kill+restart race |
| 2   | `InputMethodServiceTest` (missing pass pattern) | network/test timing; PASS in other runs |
| 3   | `sm_smoke`, `HelloBinder`, `NotificationServiceTest` | sm_smoke/HelloBinder don't touch PM at all |
| 4   | `sm_smoke`, `SystemServiceRouteTest`, `WindowServiceTest` | sm_smoke/Window don't touch PM at all |
| 5   | `InputMethodServiceTest` (exit 30) | flaky again |

The failures rotate across **8 different tests** — including
`sm_smoke` and `HelloBinder` which exercise only the C++ binder
substrate and never load the shim DEX. This is infrastructure
flakiness (vndservicemanager teardown/restart timing on cfb7c9e3),
not a CR19 regression.

**noice-discover**: launched in background; output captured to
`/tmp/noice-discover-cr19.log`. PHASE B SIGBUS recurrence (per CR15)
remains the high-water mark — CR19 does NOT change the boot path that
reaches PHASE B (PathClassLoader / class linking), so the SIGBUS
profile is identical. Critically, **no `WestlakeServiceMethodMissing`
markers appear in the noice-discover log** through PHASE B, meaning
noice's pre-SIGBUS code did not call any of the 168 newly-loud
methods. If/when PF-arch-054 is fixed and noice runs past PHASE B,
any new `[WestlakeServiceMethodMissing] packageManager.<method>` line
in the noice-discover log will reveal a previously-hidden silent PM
call and become a Tier-1 candidate for a real implementation.

### 47.7 Files touched

* `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakePackageManagerStub.java`
  (168 method bodies converted; ~25 LOC header/section comment
  updated; no method signatures changed).
* `aosp-shim.dex` rebuilt (+2,672 B).
* `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (CR19 row).
* `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this §47 + section index row).

### 47.8 Files NOT touched (per brief)

* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/CharsetPrimer.java` (CR18 may edit).
* `aosp-libbinder-port/test/SystemServiceRouteTest.java` (CR18 may
  edit).
* `shim/java/com/westlake/services/ColdBootstrap.java` (CR18 might
  create).
* Other shim service files (already CR2/CR17-converted).
* `art-latest/*`.
* `aosp-libbinder-port/` native + out + boot scripts.

### 47.9 Anti-patterns avoided

* **No per-app branches** — generic fail-loud helper, no noice-
  specific or mcd-specific branches.
* **No Tier-1 method changes** — the 11 real-impl methods are
  preserved byte-for-byte.
* **No method-signature changes** — only method bodies were rewritten.
* **No checked-exception suppression** — the throws clauses on
  Tier-1's 4 `NameNotFoundException`-declaring methods remain.

### 47.10 Anticipated CR20 candidates

If/when noice-discover runs past PHASE B, watch the log for
`[WestlakeServiceMethodMissing] packageManager.<method>` lines.
Candidates expected based on Hilt-DI / AndroidX call patterns:

* `getInstalledApplications(int)` — Hilt sometimes scans for
  `@AndroidEntryPoint` apps.
* `queryBroadcastReceivers(Intent, int)` — local broadcast manager
  setup.
* `getResourcesForApplication(ApplicationInfo)` — AppCompat theme
  resolution for the host activity.
* `getApplicationLabel(ApplicationInfo)` — toast / notification title
  defaults.

These should be reviewed when they fire; promoting any of them to
Tier-1 requires returning a meaningful default (e.g. our `mApplication
Info` cached value, or an empty list) and documenting the upgrade in
this section.

### 47.11 Person-time

~30 min total (well inside the 1-2 hr budget):
* 8 min reading codex review + existing CR2 pattern in
  `WestlakePowerManagerService` / `ServiceMethodMissing`.
* 5 min identifying Tier-1 preserves vs non-Tier-1 conversions.
* 2 min writing & running a Python one-liner to rewrite all 168
  bodies in one pass (regex match + per-line replacement).
* 5 min build + push + 5 regression runs (each ~100 s).
* 10 min documenting M4_DISCOVERY §47 + PHASE_1_STATUS row.

## 48. CR24 — PHASE B "hang" was recurring PF-arch-054 SIGBUS during signal-handler dump (2026-05-13)

### 48.0 Brief summary

The CR24 brief described `noice-discover.sh` as **hanging >13 minutes
in user-space** at PHASE B after the APK opens and ziparchive closes,
with no SIGBUS visible.  Live diagnosis (ps, wchan, simpleperf with
DWARF callchain) revealed that the spinning thread is **actually in
ART's `HandleUnexpectedSignalLinux` signal-handler dump path**, not in
any Java code.  The PF-arch-054 SIGBUS at PC=`0xfffffffffffffb17`
**still fires** when noice-discover invokes
`println("PHASE B: PathClassLoader created: " + noicePCL)` at
NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java:329 — the brief's "PF-arch-054 SIGBUS is
GONE" claim was wrong; what changed is the signal-dumper sometimes
exits cleanly with "Bus error" (this session, 18 s) and sometimes
thrashes the kernel page-fault path long enough to look like a hang
(previous session, >13 min).

### 48.1 Diagnostic methodology (took 25 min)

1. `pidof dalvikvm` → 9528, `ps -T -p 9528` → thread 9530 named
   `main-256mb` is `STAT=R / WCHAN=0`.  Confirmed brief's observation.
2. `strace -p 9530 -e trace=none -c` for 5 s → 0 syscalls.  Thread is
   pure userspace.
3. `simpleperf record --call-graph dwarf -t 9530 --duration 2` →
   topmost user frame is
   `art::HandleUnexpectedSignalLinux → HandleUnexpectedSignalCommonDump
   → UContext::Dump → StringPrintf → vsnprintf → fwrite → write`.
   Bottom of trace: kernel `do_el0_ia_bp_hardening / __handle_speculative_fault
   / handle_pte_fault` dominating (~70% of cycles) — the ARM64
   branch-predictor hardening path firing continuously during the
   ART dumper's stack walk through JIT pages.
4. Catch the log immediately after the dumper finished:
   `Fatal signal 7 (SIGBUS), code 1 (BUS_ADRALN) fault addr 0xfffffffffffffb17`
   plus the Java stack:
   ```
   at dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader.toString(Native method)
   at dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader.toString(Native method)
   at java.lang.String.valueOf(String.java:4102)
   at java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:179)
   at NoiceDiscoverWrapper.phaseB_classLoad(NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java:329)
   at NoiceDiscoverWrapper.main(NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java:210)
   ```
   This is the exact signature CR13 §3 documented for PF-arch-054.

### 48.2 Why CR15's widen-the-guard didn't catch this

The CR15 patch (runtime.cc:2750-2765) widened the **return-side
null-guard** in the `loader_to_string` lambda body to also reject the
`kPFCutStaleNativeEntry` sentinel.  But the SIGBUS happens **before**
the lambda body runs — the JNI quick-trampoline reads
`fns->NewStringUTF` from the JNINativeInterface table, finds the
sentinel `0xfffffffffffffb17` there, and `br x?` dispatches with
PC=sentinel.  The lambda's null/sentinel guard never executes.

Per CR15's open mystery (handoff_2026-05-12.md §1): **WHO writes the
sentinel into `JNINativeInterface::NewStringUTF`'s function-table slot
at vaddr `0xfad8f8`** remains unresolved.  Suggested next step is a
hw watchpoint on that slot during a `noice-discover` run; out of
scope for CR24.

### 48.3 Fix shape (CR13 fix path #1)

`aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java:325-345` — change
line 329 from `+ noicePCL` (which forces `String.valueOf(noicePCL)` →
the patched JNI `toString`) to a fixed string built from
`System.identityHashCode` + `getClass().getName()`, neither of which
triggers the JNI lambda.

Rationale for this resolution rather than a real fix:
- The brief explicitly listed `art-latest/*` as off-limits.
- The CR13 report already recommended this exact fix path #1
  ("re-flow PHASE B to print a fixed string instead of `+ noicePCL`").
- Discovery is now unblocked → all 10 PHASEs reach G4 → real
  M4-PRE15+ work can proceed (the next blocker is a
  `Configuration.setTo(null)` NPE during MainActivity.onCreate, which
  is genuinely new).

### 48.4 Acceptance

| noice-discover reaches PHASE G3 | no       | **yes**   |
| noice-discover reaches PHASE G4 | no       | **yes** (with NPE in body → expected per M4-PRE pattern) |
| regression suite total          | 13/13 PASS + 1 noice FAIL | **14/14 PASS** |

### 48.5 Open follow-ups

1. **Underlying art-latest substrate bug** (NewStringUTF slot
   corruption) remains.  CR24 sidesteps; does not fix.  Reproducer:
   revert NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java line 329 to `+ noicePCL` and
   rerun.
2. **PHASE G4 NPE on Configuration.setTo(null)** is the next
   discovery-blocking gap (this is the M4-PRE15-or-later candidate).
   Likely needs an `Activity.mConfiguration` plant in the WestlakeContextImpl
   path or a synthetic Configuration param in Activity.attach (the
   buildAttachArgs default of `new Configuration()` may not satisfy
   downstream code).

### 48.6 Person-time

- 15 min — read brief, MEMORY.md, handoff_2026-05-12.md, CR13 +
  CR18 diagnostics, NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java.
- 25 min — reproduce hang, diagnose via ps/wchan/strace/simpleperf,
  identify it as the recurring PF-arch-054 SIGBUS dump.
- 5 min — apply 5-line fix in NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java per CR13 path #1.
- 5 min — rebuild NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex + push.
- 10 min — verify PHASE G4 reached + full regression 14/14 PASS.
- 15 min — write `CR24_phaseB_hang_diagnostic.md` + M4_DISCOVERY §48
  + PHASE_1_STATUS row.

Total: ~1h 15m.

## 49. CR23-fix — Real McD VM mainImpl crash on framework.jar BCP (2026-05-13)

### 49.0 Brief summary

The 2026-05-04 baseline (`20260504_155928_mcd_pf630_boot_gate_bounded_regression`)
showed `mcd_stock_dashboard_view_attached`, `strict_dashboard_frame_present`,
and 4 views rendered.  The 2026-05-13 post-session validation
(`20260513_100920_mcd_session_validation`) showed all those FAIL plus
`vm_pid=missing`.

Initial hypothesis (per CR23 brief): CR14 + CR16 launcher slimming
deleted a load-bearing McD path.  **Diagnosis disproved that hypothesis.**
The actual breakage was not in the launcher slim — it was in the
PF-arch-053 BCP shim deployment (CR15/CR17) shifting which classes win
at runtime resolution:

| Layer | Pre-session BCP (2026-05-04) | Post-session BCP (2026-05-13) |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Core jars | core-oj, core-libart, core-icu4j | same |
| bouncycastle | yes | yes |
| `aosp-shim.dex` | yes | yes |
| `framework.jar` | **no** | **yes** |
| `ext.jar` | no | yes |
| `services.jar` | no | yes |

With `aosp-shim.dex` alone on BCP, `android.content.Context` was the
shim's concrete `Context` class — `new Context()` succeeded.  With
`framework.jar` on BCP plus `framework_duplicates.txt` stripping the
shim's `Context` from `aosp-shim.dex`, `android.content.Context` became
framework.jar's abstract class — `new Context()` immediately threw
`InstantiationError`.  Same shift hit `android.app.Activity` (also in
`framework_duplicates.txt`): framework's `Activity.attach(...)` is the
17+-arg AOSP signature, not the shim's 6-arg one, so
`activity.attach(baseContext, app, intent, component, null, mInstrumentation)`
threw `NoSuchMethodError`.  And `services.jar` on BCP introduced a
classpath collision between AOSP's stock Guava `ImmutableMap` and McD's
R8-obfuscated `ImmutableMap.m()` accessor.

The CR14+CR16 deletions are correct (they removed per-app McD hacks,
not load-bearing code).  The fix is to make the dalvikvm sandbox tolerate
the framework.jar BCP — which is the **architectural** target — instead
of un-deleting per-app code.

### 49.1 Three load-bearing fixes (no per-app branches)

1. **`new Context()` → `WestlakeContextImpl`** in
   `shim/java/android/app/WestlakeActivityThread.java` lines 241 and 1273.
   Added `WestlakeActivityThread.buildBaseContext(packageName, classLoader)`
   that constructs a `WestlakeContextImpl` (the architectural Context
   type, per the FROZEN-SURFACE comment in
   `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeContextImpl.java`), with a
   `new Context()` fallback for the legacy shim-only-BCP path.  Plus
   `publishApplicationToBaseContext(baseContext, app)` that calls
   `WestlakeContextImpl.setAttachedApplication(app)` so Hilt's
   `dagger.hilt.android.internal.Contexts.getApplication(Context)` chain
   resolves.

2. **Tolerant `activity.attach(...)` in `attachActivity()`**:
   `shim/java/android/app/WestlakeActivityThread.java` line 3017.  Wrap
   the 6-arg call in `try { ... } catch (NoSuchMethodError | LinkageError)`
   and fall through to the existing field-setting path on failure.
   Generic — applies to any APK whose Activity inherits from framework's
   `android.app.Activity`.

3. **`mBase` field path uses `ContextWrapper.class`**:
   `shim/java/android/app/WestlakeActivityThread.java` line 3063.
   `mBase` is declared on `android.content.ContextWrapper`, not on
   `Context`.  With framework.jar on BCP, `Context.class.getDeclaredField("mBase")`
   throws `NoSuchFieldException`; `ContextWrapper.class.getDeclaredField("mBase")`
   succeeds.

4. **services.jar off the BCP for app processes**:
   `westlake-host-gradle/app/src/main/java/com/westlake/host/WestlakeVM.kt`
   line 819.  `services.jar` is a system_server-only jar; including it in
   an app process triggers the Guava `ImmutableMap` collision flagged in
   `aosp-libbinder-port/M4_PRE_NOTES.md` line 181.  The host APK now
   matches the `--bcp-framework-strict` shape from `m3-dalvikvm-boot.sh`
   line 42-50 (framework.jar + ext.jar, no services.jar).

### 49.2 Why NOT add an `isMcDonaldsLaunch` branch

All four fixes are architectural — they apply to any APK that uses the
dalvikvm sandbox plus the BCP shim deployment.  Adding per-app branches
would re-introduce the very pattern CR14+CR16 deleted.

### 49.3 Verification

- Regression suite **14/14 PASS** (was 13/14 prior — noice-discover
  previously FAIL because of CR24's PHASE B SIGBUS; now PASS).
- McD VM subprocess **spawns successfully** post-CR23-fix.  The VM
  reaches `McDMarketApplication.onCreate()` and Activity instantiation
  — vs the pre-fix `vm_pid=missing` because the VM exited within ~1s
  of mainImpl with `InstantiationError: android.content.Context`.
- McD dashboard **does NOT yet attach** — the Activity is instantiated
  but its `Window` is null when McD's onCreate calls
  `Activity.setTheme(int)`, which calls `Window.setTheme(int)` on a
  null reference.  The framework `Activity.mWindow` field is normally
  populated by AOSP `ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity` via the full
  17+-arg `attach(...)` call we can't replay.  Fixing this is **out of
  scope for CR23-fix**: it requires either (a) building a complete
  AOSP-compatible Window plumbing path through framework.jar (likely
  M4-window territory, akin to M4d for Display), or (b) reverting the
  BCP to shim-only for McD launches (regression on the M5/M6 binder
  pivot).

### 49.4 Files touched

- `shim/java/android/app/WestlakeActivityThread.java`
  - Added static `buildBaseContext(String, ClassLoader)` and
    `publishApplicationToBaseContext(Context, Application)`.
  - `makeApplication()` line 241 changed `new Context()` →
    `createApplicationBaseContext(packageName, classLoader)`.
  - `performLaunchActivityImpl()` line 1273 (now 1293) changed
    `new Context()` → `buildBaseContext(packageName, cl)`.
  - `attachActivity()` line 3019 wrapped `activity.attach(...)` in
    `try/catch (NoSuchMethodError | LinkageError)` with fall-through.
  - `attachActivity()` line 3063 changed `setInstanceField(..., Context.class, "mBase", ...)`
    → `... ContextWrapper.class, "mBase", ...`.
- `westlake-host-gradle/app/src/main/java/com/westlake/host/WestlakeVM.kt`
  - Removed auto-detection of `services.jar` from the constructed BCP.
- `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` (this section)
- `docs/engine/WESTLAKE_LAUNCHER_AUDIT.md` (footnote on CR23-fix)
- `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` (row update)
- `aosp-shim.dex` rebuilt (size delta: +492 bytes, 1387404 → 1387896).

### 49.5 Files NOT touched (per CR23-fix brief)

- `shim/java/com/westlake/services/*` (all M4 services + Context) —
  the FROZEN-SURFACE classes in this dir continue to evolve under M4a-e
  briefs.  CR23-fix only **uses** WestlakeContextImpl; it doesn't
  modify it.
- `shim/java/com/westlake/engine/WestlakeLauncher.java` — turned out
  not to need launcher edits; the breakage was in WestlakeActivityThread
  and host APK BCP construction.
- `aosp-libbinder-port/*` — CR24 is active in `test/`.
- `art-latest/*` — CR24 may be active there.
- Other shim Java files except `WestlakeActivityThread.java`.

### 49.6 Person-time

- 20 min — read brief, MEMORY.md, pre/post-session logcat diff to
  confirm divergence point.
- 30 min — diagnose `InstantiationError: android.content.Context` →
  trace to `new Context()` in WAT lines 241 and 1191 → identify
  WestlakeContextImpl as the architectural replacement.
- 20 min — apply Context fix + rebuild + first phone test.
- 15 min — diagnose `NoSuchMethodError: ImmutableMap.m()` →
  trace to services.jar on BCP → match aosp-libbinder-port/M4_PRE_NOTES.md
  guidance → remove services.jar from host APK BCP.
- 25 min — rebuild host APK + diagnose
  `NoSuchMethodError: Activity.attach(6 args)` → wrap call in try/catch
  fall-through + fix `mBase` field path on `ContextWrapper.class`.
- 10 min — verify regression 14/14 + final McD test (now blocks on
  `Window.setTheme on null`, out of scope per §49.3 (b)).
- 20 min — write M4_DISCOVERY §49 + audit footnote + PHASE_1_STATUS row.

Total: ~2h.

## 50. CR27 — Refactor `NoiceDiscoverWrapper` to manifest-driven base class for 2nd-app reuse (2026-05-13)

### 50.0 Brief summary

Codex review #2 Tier 3 finding (verbatim quote):

> `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` is still sensible as a discovery harness, but
> at 1174 LOC it is now carrying app config, boot sequencing, service
> registration, synthetic activity/application info, and phase
> orchestration.  It should become manifest-driven before it is reused for
> a second app.

CR27 splits the original `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` (1195 LOC including
the CR24 fix) into:

1. **`DiscoverWrapperBase.java`** (NEW, 1140 LOC) — generic phase
   orchestration.  Reads a Java `Properties` manifest at startup for all
   per-app configuration (package name, APK path, Application class, main
   activity class, target SDK, classload candidates).  Owns every PHASE A
   through G implementation verbatim from the original — but now sourced
   per-app from the manifest, not hard-coded constants.
2. **`NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java`** (slimmed to 60 LOC) — thin shim that
   declares its JNI-bound `println`/`eprintln` natives (because
   `art-latest/stubs/binder_jni_stub.cc` binds them by class name and the
   brief forbids touching `art-latest`) and calls
   `DiscoverWrapperBase.runFromManifest(noice.discover.properties, printer)`.
3. **`McdDiscoverWrapper.java`** (NEW, 70 LOC) — the second consumer.
   Mirrors the noice shim but points at `mcd.discover.properties`.  Reuses
   `AsInterfaceTest.println` as the JNI print bridge (same pattern as
   DisplayServiceTest / NotificationServiceTest etc. — see
   `aosp-libbinder-port/test/DisplayServiceTest.java:32-41`).
4. **`noice.discover.properties`** (NEW, 33 lines) — extracted noice
   constants: package name `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice`, application
   `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice.NoiceApplication`, main activity
   `com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice.activity.MainActivity`, target SDK 33,
   classload candidates list.
5. **`mcd.discover.properties`** (NEW, 40 lines) — McD constants extracted
   from `artifacts/real-mcd/apktool_decoded/AndroidManifest.xml`: package
   `com.mcdonalds.app`, application
   `com.mcdonalds.app.application.McDMarketApplication`, main activity
   `com.mcdonalds.mcdcoreapp.common.activity.SplashActivity`, target SDK
   35, classload candidates list.
6. **`build_mcd_discover_wrapper.sh`** (NEW, 95 lines) — compiles
   `McdDiscoverWrapper.dex` (mirrors `build_discover.sh` but bundles
   `AsInterfaceTest.class` for the println bridge).
7. **`mcd-discover.sh`** (NEW, 125 lines) — boot script (mirrors
   `noice-discover.sh`, swaps test class + log paths).

### 50.1 LOC accounting

| File                          | Pre-CR27 | Post-CR27 | Delta  |
|-------------------------------|---------:|----------:|-------:|
| NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java     | 1195     | 60        | -1135  |
| DiscoverWrapperBase.java      | —        | 1140      | +1140  |
| McdDiscoverWrapper.java       | —        | 70        | +70    |
| noice.discover.properties     | —        | 33        | +33    |
| mcd.discover.properties       | —        | 40        | +40    |
| **Total (test/ Java)**        | **1195** | **1270**  | **+75** |

The +75 LOC overhead (≈6%) is the cost of generic-ness:
- Manifest loader (`loadManifest` + `req` + `splitCsv` ≈ 60 LOC).
- Printer interface + delegation (≈ 25 LOC across base + 2 shims).
- McD subclass scaffolding (≈ 30 LOC).

Plus two `.properties` files (73 LOC) where per-app data now lives —
extracted from previously-hard-coded constants in the noice file and
NEW for McD.

### 50.2 Manifest schema

Java `Properties` format (newline-separated `key=value` with `#` comments).
See `loadManifest()` in `DiscoverWrapperBase.java`:

```
app.packageName=...       # AndroidManifest <manifest package=>
app.apkPath=...           # absolute path on phone
app.applicationClass=...  # AndroidManifest <application android:name=>
app.mainActivityClass=... # main launcher activity class FQN
app.targetSdkVersion=NN   # int
app.dataDir=...           # optional; defaults to /data/local/tmp/westlake/<packageName>
phase.probeServices=a,b,c # optional CSV; default is the curated ~70 services
phase.classloadCandidates=a,b,c # optional CSV of FQNs for PHASE B probing
```

### 50.3 Acceptance

**Build**:
- `bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_discover.sh` → `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.dex`
  rebuilt, 35 KB (post-CR24: 32 KB; +3 KB from the manifest loader + Printer
  delegation).
- `bash aosp-libbinder-port/build_mcd_discover_wrapper.sh` →
  `McdDiscoverWrapper.dex` produced, 40 KB.

**Runtime regression on phone `cfb7c9e3`**:

| Test                                | Pre-CR27 | Post-CR27 |
|-------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| noice-discover (W2/M4-PRE)          | PHASE G4 | **PHASE G4** (unchanged) |
| McdDiscoverWrapper (NEW)            | —        | **PHASE G3** |

The noice run reaches PHASE G4 exactly as the post-CR24 baseline did
(MainActivity.onCreate failing at `Configuration.setTo(null)` NPE — the
next M4-PRE15-class boundary).

The McD run is more interesting — it reaches **PHASE G3** on the first
attempt with:
- PHASE A: 7/70 services resolved (same as noice; service set is shared).
- PHASE B: **7/7 classes loadable** — McDMarketApplication,
  SplashActivity, ROAInAppDeeplinkNotificationActivity, AboutActivity,
  HelpCenterActivity, CoreComponentFactory, SignInHubActivity ALL resolve
  through the McD APK's PathClassLoader.
- PHASE C: PASSED — `new McDMarketApplication()` instantiated cleanly.
- PHASE D: PASSED — `attachBaseContext(WestlakeContextImpl)` returns OK;
  Application is publishable.
- PHASE E: FAILED expected — `McDMarketApplication.onCreate()` throws
  (the M4-PRE-class discovery boundary for McD; different binder lookups
  than noice's Hilt path).
- PHASE F: 5 framework Singletons probed, 1 failed (DisplayManager).
- PHASE G2: PASSED — Instrumentation.newActivity(SplashActivity) returns
  a real instance.
- PHASE G3: FAILED — Activity.attach (20-arg signature on Android 15)
  throws inside the call — the M4-PRE4-class candidate for McD, likely
  the same PhoneWindow ctor NPE noice originally hit (separate fix needed,
  out of CR27 scope).

This output IS the deliverable.  CR27 was not asked to make McD reach
some specific phase; it was asked to prove the harness is reusable.  The
regression run reaching G3 on the first attempt — without touching
`art-latest`, `aosp-shim.dex`, or any of the M4 services — is proof.

**Full regression suite** (`bash scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh`):
two consecutive runs both pass noice-discover; both runs show the same
EBUSY-race infra flake on 2-3 of the M4 service tests (rotating tests
across runs, with `Binder ioctl to become context manager failed: Device
or resource busy`).  This is the **known CR7-class servicemanager-EBUSY
flake** documented under the CR19 row in `PHASE_1_STATUS.md` and is NOT
caused by CR27.  Notably noice-discover passed in both runs, confirming
the refactor preserves its end-to-end behaviour.

### 50.4 Files touched

- `aosp-libbinder-port/test/DiscoverWrapperBase.java` (NEW, 1140 LOC).
- `aosp-libbinder-port/test/NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` (1195 → 60 LOC).
- `aosp-libbinder-port/test/McdDiscoverWrapper.java` (NEW, 70 LOC).

- `aosp-libbinder-port/build_discover.sh` (+8 LOC: bundle base + inner
  classes, doc CR27).
- `aosp-libbinder-port/build_mcd_discover_wrapper.sh` (NEW, 95 lines).

- `aosp-libbinder-port/out/McdDiscoverWrapper.dex` (NEW, 40 KB).

### 50.5 Files NOT touched (per brief)

- `shim/java/com/westlake/services/*` — CR25 parallel agent is editing
  `WestlakeResources` / `WestlakeContextImpl` for the Window.setTheme(null)
  fix.
- `aosp-shim.dex` — no rebuild needed; this is test side.
- `art-latest/*` — explicitly forbidden; preserved verbatim.
- `aosp-libbinder-port/aosp-src/*`, `native/*`, `out/*` (except the
  rebuilt test dexes).
- Boot scripts other than the new `mcd-discover.sh` (CR7 stable).
- `scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh` (auto-discovers tests; no edit
  needed; would add `mcd-discover` as a regression entry only on later
  CR).

### 50.6 Anti-patterns avoided

- **No per-app branches in the base class.**  Every reference to noice
  or McD in `DiscoverWrapperBase.java` is in comments or doc strings
  only; all per-app data flows through manifest fields.  Reviewer can
  `grep -n "noice\|mcdonalds" DiscoverWrapperBase.java` to confirm only
  comments match.
- **No speculative widening.**  The Properties schema has exactly the
  keys the two current consumers need:
  packageName/apkPath/applicationClass/mainActivityClass/targetSdkVersion
  plus the optional probeServices/classloadCandidates overrides.  No
  unused keys.
- **The refactor preserves CR24's PF-arch-054 workaround.**  The
  `String.valueOf(appPCL)` SIGBUS sidestep — `identityHashCode +
  getClass().getName()` instead of `+ appPCL` concatenation — was
  preserved verbatim in `DiscoverWrapperBase.phaseB_classLoad`.

### 50.7 Person-time

~2.5h (within 2-3 hour budget):
- 20 min — inventory + grep through NoiceDiscoverWrapper to map
  per-app constants vs generic phase logic.
- 45 min — write `DiscoverWrapperBase.java` (line-by-line port of phase
  methods + new manifest loader).
- 30 min — write thin `NoiceDiscoverWrapper` + `McdDiscoverWrapper` +
  the two `.properties` files + `mcd-discover.sh` + `build_mcd_discover_wrapper.sh`.
- 20 min — debug JNI-binding issue (`Java_NoiceDiscoverWrapper_println`
  must live on the NAMED subclass, not on the base) → switch base to
  a `Printer` interface that subclasses inject.
- 15 min — find + fix anonymous-inner-class packaging bug (dx wildcard
  for `Wrapper$1.class`).
- 15 min — restore CR24 workaround that an interim CR26 edit had
  reverted; re-build + re-deploy.
- 25 min — phone verification (noice still PHASE G4, McD reaches G3) +
  two regression runs to confirm noice-discover stays PASS and
  failures rotate (proving they are infra flake not CR27).
- 30 min — write this §50 + PHASE_1_STATUS row.

## 51. CR26 — substrate fix for the PF-arch-054 sentinel SIGBUS (PF-arch-055; 2026-05-13)

CR13 / CR15 / CR24 chased a SIGBUS at `fault_addr=0xfffffffffffffb17`
in the patched `BaseDexClassLoader.toString` JNI lambda at
`art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc:2750`.  CR15 widened the
zero-only `cbz x2` null-guard to also reject the
`kPFCutStaleNativeEntry` sentinel; CR24 sidestepped the call site
entirely in the harness.  Neither addressed the underlying bug.

CR26 closed the open question "**who writes the sentinel into
`JNINativeInterface::NewStringUTF`?**" with a definitive answer:
**no one in art-latest source**.  Audit:

* `grep -rn "kPFCutStaleNativeEntry\|0xfffffffffffffb17" art-latest/`
  returns 48 references; **every one is a READER** (detect-and-repair).
* `grep -rn "= 0xfffffffffffffb17\|= kPFCut\b"` returns zero
  assignments outside the constexpr definitions.
* `LC_ALL=C grep -ao --byte-offset
   "$(printf '\\x17\\xfb\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff')" dalvikvm | wc -l`
  returns **0** — the 28 MB compiled binary contains zero literal
  copies of the sentinel byte pattern.

The static `gJniNativeInterface` table at vaddr `0xfad3c0` is
well-formed in .rodata (`od -An -tx8 -N16 -j 0xdab8f8 dalvikvm` →
`00000000006a583c 00000000006a5b74`).  Therefore on the failing call
path, `env->functions` is **not** pointing at the real
`gJniNativeInterface` — it is pointing at corrupted / uninitialized
memory whose offset 1336 happens to be the sentinel (or, in CR13's
earlier observation, ASCII garbage like `0x6f6874656d2063` = `"c
method "`).  Widening the guard cannot protect against arbitrary
random pointer values at that slot; only **bypassing the vtable
entirely** can.

**Fix (PF-arch-055):** rewrite the patched lambda to use ART-internal
APIs that do not traverse the JNINativeInterface vtable.

```cpp
static auto loader_to_string = +[](JNIEnv* env, jobject) -> jstring {
  if (env == nullptr) return nullptr;
  Thread* self = Thread::Current();
  if (self == nullptr) return nullptr;
  ScopedObjectAccess soa(self);
  ObjPtr<mirror::String> result =
      mirror::String::AllocFromModifiedUtf8(
          soa.Self(), "dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[westlake]");
  if (result == nullptr) {
    if (soa.Self()->IsExceptionPending()) soa.Self()->ClearException();
    return nullptr;
  }
  JNIEnvExt* env_ext = down_cast<JNIEnvExt*>(soa.Self()->GetJniEnv());
  if (env_ext == nullptr) return nullptr;
  return env_ext->AddLocalReference<jstring>(result);
};
```

Disassembly verification: the new function body at vaddr `0x6744b4`
(size 0xf8, was 0x24) contains direct `bl mirror::String::
AllocFromModifiedUtf8` and `bl JNIEnvExt::AddLocalReference` calls,
with **no `ldr x?, [x?, #1336]` slot read** and **no `cmn x?, #1257`
sentinel check** — the new code path simply does not traverse the
vtable at all.

**Verification:**
* CR24 workaround temporarily reverted in `DiscoverWrapperBase.java`
  (replaced `+ appPCL` with `identityHashCode + getName()` reverted
  back to `+ appPCL`); CR26 dalvikvm deployed.  noice-discover.sh
  exits 0, **PHASE A-G4 all reached**, 0 SIGBUS occurrences in log.
* CR24 workaround restored as belt-and-suspenders; full regression
  suite: **14/14 PASS**.
* CR15's widened guard is now dead code in the compiled body (the
  new body never reads `[env, #1336]`) but is left in the source
  as documentation of the prior attempt.
* CR24's `identityHashCode + getName()` workaround is retained
  verbatim in `DiscoverWrapperBase.java:438-461` (with one updated
  comment block noting CR26 substrate fix has landed).

**Files touched:**
- `art-latest/patches/runtime/runtime.cc` (lines 2745-2820) —
  replaced lambda body to use ART-internal APIs
- `art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm` — rebuilt
  (md5 `c4ab142009d534fdf2b1b5b68fc2575c`, was
  `807cf33956a94994e48e96e95c046f3e`)
- `art-latest/patches/PF-arch-055-pfcut-fix-at-source.patch` (NEW)
- `aosp-libbinder-port/diagnostics/CR26_pfcut_sentinel_writer.md`
  (NEW, ~7 KB)
- `aosp-libbinder-port/test/DiscoverWrapperBase.java` — comment
  block at lines 440-457 updated to reference CR26; behavior
  unchanged
- `docs/engine/M4_DISCOVERY.md` — this §51 row
- `docs/engine/PHASE_1_STATUS.md` — new CR26 entry

**Person-time:** ~2h 10m (inside 2-4h brief budget).

**Follow-ups left open:**
1. The deeper question — **why does `env->functions` get corrupted
   on the discover-harness call path?** — is not answered.  CR26
   bypasses the read rather than fixing the original corruption.
   Candidate explanations include stack-allocated JNIEnv on a worker
   thread with uninitialized functions pointer, PFCutBlocklist
   repair re-pointing functions mid-call, and Magisk hot-patching
   (unverifiable on cfb7c9e3).  None affect the immediate bug;
   future investigators may want to chase the root cause with
   `hw watchpoint --write 0xfad8f8` per CR13 §6.3.
2. CR24's workaround can be removed in a future cleanup once an
   audit confirms no other shim call path triggers JNI-vtable
   poisoning (`grep -rn "+ .*PathClassLoader\|+ .*ClassLoader" shim/`).
3. CR15's widened guard can be removed from the source in a future
   cleanup (it's dead code post-CR26).

### 52.0. Why V2 — the architectural pivot

By the morning of 2026-05-13, M4-PRE12, M4-PRE13, M4-PRE14, and CR23-fix
had each substituted one piece of `system_server`'s ~200-field cold-boot
graph. M4-PRE12 planted `AssetManager.mValue` + `mOffsets`; M4-PRE13
planted `Configuration.mLocaleList`; M4-PRE14 planted
`ResourcesImpl.mDisplayAdjustments`; CR23-fix wrapped `Activity.attach`
in `try/catch try-fallback` because framework.jar's Activity didn't have
our 6-arg signature. The pattern was clear: each milestone uncovered
the next missing field, with no architectural bound on how many
fields remained.

The user's correction (`feedback_subtraction_not_addition.md`-class):
*"we decided to include binder to the westlake engine so we only need to
deal with macro shim api"*. V1's "AOSP framework.jar runs unmodified" was
misread to mean "real Activity.attach / Application.attach / ResourcesImpl
machinery runs in dalvikvm if we plant the right cold-init fields". That
path is unbounded.

**V2 correction**: keep V1's binder substrate (M1/M2/M3 + the six M4
services) as-is for cross-process boundaries. Move the in-process Java
substitution boundary from "plant framework cold-init fields" to
"classpath-shadow the framework class outright" via
`framework_duplicates.txt`, the same mechanism CR23-fix already used
for `Context`. Westlake shadows `android.app.Activity`,
`android.app.Application`, `android.view.Window`,
`com.android.internal.policy.PhoneWindow`, `DecorView`,
`WindowManagerImpl`. Real androidx Fragment + Hilt run unmodified on
top because their dependencies are Activity public/protected API
which our generic shadow satisfies.

CR28-architect captured this in `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` (read-only;
~960 LOC). V2-Step1..Step8-fix implemented and verified it across
~14h of swarm work.

### 52.1. V2-Step1 — `WESTLAKE_ACTIVITY_API.md` API surface (~2.5h, architect-only)

Per `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §7 Step 1: classified every
public+protected method of AOSP API 30 `android.app.Activity` into
Implement / fail-loud / no-op buckets for Step 2's `WestlakeActivity`
shadow class. **324 methods** total (308 public+protected + 11
package-private architecturally-critical + 5 inner-class methods);
buckets sized at **Implement = 87** (27%), **fail-loud = 178** (55%),
**no-op = 14** unambiguous safe constants. Identified 10 surprises
including `attach` package-private (must be promoted to public in the
shadow), `requestPermissions` / `runOnUiThread` / `setResult` /
`getApplication` / `getActivityThread` all `final`, and `isResumed()`
load-bearing for Compose. 22 instance fields + 7 constants. 4 open
questions for Step 2 implementer (ContextThemeWrapper inheritance
route; Activity.mFragments synthetic stub; attach order; getAssistToken
synthetic IBinder).

**No source code touched.** Output: `docs/engine/WESTLAKE_ACTIVITY_API.md`
(~500 LOC across §0-§12).

### 52.2. V2-Step2 — `shim/java/android/app/Activity.java` (~3h 10m)

Per `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §3.3 decision 10-B + §7 Step 2 and
`WESTLAKE_ACTIVITY_API.md` §2-§8: rewrote V1 `Activity` (1083 LOC) as
classpath-shadow `WestlakeActivity` (1209 LOC) extending
`android.view.ContextThemeWrapper` (compile-time: shim's; runtime:
framework.jar's via `framework_duplicates.txt` keep). 23 instance fields,
7 constants, ~294 methods (Implement 129 + fail-loud 165). The 6-arg
`attach(Context, Application, Intent, ComponentName, Window,
Instrumentation)` overload matches `WestlakeActivityThread.attachActivity`
(CR23-fix L3030 call site).

`framework_duplicates.txt` L83 comment-out — `android/app/Activity` no
longer stripped from shim DEX, so shim wins resolution at classpath
shadow time. `aosp-shim.dex` 1,394,612 → 1,442,172 bytes (+47,560 B /
+3.4%).

**Anti-patterns avoided**: zero per-app branches; no `Unsafe.allocateInstance`;
no `Field.setAccessible` for self-mutation; no `MiniServer.currentPackageName()`
/ `HostBridge.*` couplings.

### 52.3. V2-Step3 — `shim/java/android/app/Application.java` (~1h 5m)

Per `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §3.2 decision 9-C (classpath shadow) +
§7 Step 3: replaced V1 `Application` (100 LOC) with V2 (~430 LOC)
extending `ContextWrapper` (compile-time: shim's; runtime: framework's,
since ContextWrapper stays in `framework_duplicates.txt` and strip-wins).
Ships AOSP API 30 public/protected surface: lifecycle hooks
(`onCreate`/`onTerminate`/`onConfigurationChanged`/`onLowMemory`/
`onTrimMemory`), register/unregister for ActivityLifecycleCallbacks +
ComponentCallbacks + OnProvideAssistDataListener, `getProcessName()`,
package-private `attach(Context)`, 20 package-private
`dispatchActivityXxx` hooks (consumed by WestlakeActivity Step 2
`performXxx` family).

`framework_duplicates.txt` L95-97 comment-out — `android/app/Application`
no longer stripped, so shim wins.

**V1 backward-compat only**: package-private `setPackageName(String)`
kept as `@Deprecated` no-op so existing `ShimCompat.setPackageName(app,
pkg)` callers still compile. Marked for V2-Step8 deletion alongside
MiniServer.

### 52.4. V2-Step4 — Thin `WestlakeResources` + `ResourceArscParser` (~2.5h)

Per `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §3.4 decision 11-B + §7 Step 4: the
single most architecturally-important Step in V2. **Deletes the V1
plant chain** (M4-PRE12/13/14 + `buildReflective` totalling ~244 LOC of
`sun.misc.Unsafe.allocateInstance` + `Field.setAccessible` reflection).

**3 new classes:**
- `shim/java/com/westlake/services/ResourceArscParser.java` (NEW, 419 LOC):
  façade over the existing `android.content.res.ResourceTable` chunk
  walker; adds APK-level parsing (ZipFile + `resources.arsc` entry read),
  flat `Map<Integer,ResourceValue>` view, layout XML blob extraction,
  assets/ snapshot, transitive TYPE_REFERENCE resolution. Generic across
  apps; no per-app branches.
- `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeAssetManager.java` (NEW, 190 LOC):
  thin asset-manager substitute composed over `ResourceArscParser.Parsed`.
  NOT a subclass of framework `android.content.res.AssetManager` (final +
  framework_duplicates.txt-stripped; type-incompatible). Exposes the AOSP
  AssetManager methods noice / McD / AndroidX / Hilt actually call.
- `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeResources.java` (REWRITTEN,
  545 → 332 LOC, -39%): `extends Resources` with
  `super(WestlakeResources.class.getClassLoader())` targeting framework
  Resources's `@UnsupportedAppUsage public Resources(ClassLoader)` ctor
  (native-free; just sets `mClassLoader`). Overrides ~30 public methods
  (`getString` / `getText` / `getXml` / `getLayout` / `getValue` / etc.)
  to delegate to `ResourceArscParser`.

`shim/java/android/content/res/Resources.java` (+15 LOC): added the
public 1-arg `Resources(ClassLoader)` ctor matching framework's hidden
public ctor so the subclass `super(...)` call resolves at compile
time.

**Regression**: `binder-pivot-regression.sh --full` → 14/14 PASS;
noice-discover reaches PHASE G2 (MainActivity instantiated). PHASE G3
now blocked by parallel V2-Step2 work's 6-arg Activity.attach reshape
(NOT a Step 4 regression).

### 52.5. V2-Step5 — `Window` / `PhoneWindow` / `DecorView` / `WindowManagerImpl` (~75m)

Per `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §3.5 decision 12-A + §7 Step 5: created
+ replaced the 4 Window-substrate shadow classes.

- `shim/java/android/view/Window.java` (REWROTE, V1 876 LOC → V2 423 LOC,
  -51.7%): removed V1's per-app McDonalds structured-page-shell +
  toolbar-alias-views + `ensureMcdToolbarShell` logic (~450 LOC of
  per-app branches violating the "NO per-app hacks" rule). Clean generic
  surface: `setContentView(int|View|View,LP)`, `getDecorView` /
  `peekDecorView` / `findViewById<T>`, `setTheme(int)` no-op, Tier-1
  feature/progress/decor constants, Callback inner interface (16 required
  + 8 newer-AOSP defaulted-to-no-op via `default` methods so Activity
  doesn't need to override them). Kept concrete (not abstract per task
  pseudocode) because 3 sites in Activity.java + WestlakeActivityThread.java
  call `new android.view.Window(this)`.
- `shim/java/com/android/internal/policy/PhoneWindow.java` (NEW, 44 LOC):
  3 ctor overloads all delegating to `super(context)`.
- `shim/java/com/android/internal/policy/DecorView.java` (NEW, 22 LOC):
  empty class extending `android.widget.FrameLayout`.
- `shim/java/com/android/internal/policy/WindowControllerCallback.java`
  (NEW, 13 LOC): opaque interface stub for PhoneWindow's 3-arg ctor.
- `shim/java/android/view/WindowManagerImpl.java` (NEW, 87 LOC):
  `implements WindowManager`; `getDefaultDisplay()` reflectively routes
  to `DisplayManager.getDisplay(DEFAULT_DISPLAY)` (M4d-backed);
  `addView`/`updateViewLayout`/`removeView` no-op until M6 surface
  daemon lands.

`framework_duplicates.txt` L1567 comment-out for `android/view/Window`
(the other 3 classes were never in the strip list).

### 52.6. V2-Step6 — Rewire `WestlakeActivityThread.attachActivity` (~50m)

Per `docs/engine/V2_STEP6_DIFF_SPEC.md` + `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md`
§7 Step 6: replaced V1's 274-LOC `attachActivity(Activity, Context,
Application, Intent, ComponentName)` (with CR23-fix's `strictStandalone`
/ `runMcdonaldsLifecycle` / `strictSkipLifecycle` flag matrix + shim-attach
try/catch fallback + 5 field-plant reflection blocks + AndroidX init +
ResourceTable wiring + ~20 `PF301 strict WAT attachActivity ...`
markers) with a **10-LOC body** calling
`activity.attach(baseContext, app, intent, component, /*window*/null,
mInstrumentation)` directly — no reflection, no try/catch, no field-set
fallback.

The 6-arg `Activity.attach` IS our code via classpath shadowing
(V2-Step2 landed it; `framework_duplicates.txt` L83 strips framework.jar's
Activity so our shim wins resolution). V2-Step2's `attachInternal(...)`
records all V2-live fields and instantiates `mWindow = new PhoneWindow(this)`
(per V2 §3.5, V2-Step5's PhoneWindow shadow).

**Helpers deleted (3):** `ensureActivityWindow` (130 LOC of Window/PhoneWindow
synthesis hack via reflection on framework Window's `mContext`/`mWindow`/
`setCallback`); `initializeAndroidxActivityState` (47 LOC orchestrator
of 4 AndroidX state-init helpers); `setInstanceField` (6 LOC field-plant
primitive whose only callers were `attachActivity` + `ensureActivityWindow`).

**LOC delta**: `WestlakeActivityThread.java` 5319 → 4887 (-432 LOC / -8.1%).

### 52.7. V2-Step7 — Plant residue audit + WestlakeLauncher slim (~2h)

Per `BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §7 Step 7 + `MIGRATION_FROM_V1.md` §4 +
`V2_STEP7_PLANT_RESIDUE_AUDIT.md`: audited 8 plant-residue candidates
orphaned by Step 4 (M4-PRE12/13/14 + Unsafe + Field.setAccessible
removal from WestlakeResources) and Step 6 (`ensureActivityWindow` +
`initializeAndroidxActivityState` + `setInstanceField` removal from
WestlakeActivityThread).

**Audit dispositions:**
- (1) `aosp-libbinder-port/test/CharsetPrimer.java` — KEEP (test-harness only).
- (2) `shim/java/com/westlake/services/ColdBootstrap.java` (311 LOC) —
  KEEP defense-in-depth, zero production callers but `ActivityThread.currentActivityThread()`
  may still be reached from framework.jar paths in V2; marked
  V2-Step8 deletion candidate.
- (3) `art-latest/stubs/assetmanager_jni_stub.cc` (901 LOC) — DEAD
  post-Step 4 (`WestlakeAssetManager` is NOT a subclass of framework
  AssetManager; the 56 RegisterNatives'd methods are unreachable) but
  kept in tree per brief's "FILES NOT TO TOUCH: art-latest/*" rule.
- (4) `WestlakeLauncher.wireStandaloneActivityResources` + 5-helper cluster —
  **DELETED** (294 LOC across 6 methods).
- (5) `WestlakeActivityThread.isCutoffCanaryLifecycleProbe` +
  `shouldRunMcdonaldsLifecycleInStrict` — KEEP (still load-bearing via
  `forceLifecycleInStrict`); marked V2-Step8 candidate.
- (6) `WestlakeContextImpl.java` — KEEP unchanged (CR22-frozen surface).
- (7) ART substrate dead-code (CR15's widened guard) — KEEP, queued for
  ART-rebuild slot.
- (8) `NoiceDiscoverWrapper.java` CR24 sentinel workaround — KEEP
  belt-and-suspenders.

**Deletion applied (Target 4)**: `WestlakeLauncher.java` lines 2022-2316
(6 methods, 294 LOC). Zero production callers verified; replaced by
26-line rationale comment. V1 hack purpose (per-Activity
`ShimCompat.setApkPath` / `setAssetApkPath` / `setAssetDir` + arsc
parse via `new ResourceTable()` + bulk `res.registerLayoutBytes`) is
all subsumed by V2-Step4's `WestlakeResources` /
`ResourceArscParser` / `WestlakeAssetManager`.

**LOC delta**: `WestlakeLauncher.java` 12,668 → 12,403 LOC (-265 net);
`aosp-shim.dex` 1,433,252 → 1,428,152 bytes (-5,100 B, -0.36%).

Regression: 1 PASS / 13 FAIL / 0 SKIP on degraded phone state, but the
pre-Step7 dex (rebuilt + pushed for baseline-revert check) showed
**identical 1 PASS / 13 FAIL** — confirming Step 7 was regression-neutral.
The phone state had degraded from the V2-Step6 row's note about
vndservicemanager zombie accumulation. The 13 FAILs share root cause
`java.lang.NullPointerException: Charset.newEncoder() on a null object
reference` — which V2-Step8-fix resolved.

### 52.8. V2-Step8-fix — Charset.newEncoder NPE root-caused; 14/14 PASS restored (~1h 30m)

Per `docs/engine/V2_STEP8_FIX_CHARSET_NPE.md`: the V2-Step8 brief's
hypothesis "Charset.newEncoder NPE breaking all dalvikvm tests post-V2
substrate" was **wrong about the cause but right about the symptom**.

**Root cause**: `/data/local/tmp/westlake/dalvikvm` was a STALE binary
(26591064 bytes, May 2 build, SHA-256 `d7e10e47...`) deployed by
`scripts/sync-westlake-phone-runtime.sh` which sources from
`ohos-deploy/arm64-a15/dalvikvm`. That binary predates
`art-latest/stubs/openjdk_stub.c`'s `android_runtime_stub` static-success
handler (May 12 13:13 source change at line 1262), so `Runtime_nativeLoad`
falls through to `dlopen()` which is a stub in bionic-static (`libdl.a
is a stub`), throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError`. The current
`art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm` (28266016 bytes, SHA-256
`cd3348d7...`) DOES have the handler.

**Effect chain**:
1. Tests' `System.loadLibrary("android_runtime_stub")` throws ULE.
2. `HelloBinder` / `BCP-shim` / `BCP-framework` catch it and
   `System.exit(10)` silently — the regression script grades them
   FAIL because pass-grep "HelloBinder: PASS" never matches.
3. `AsInterfaceTest` / M4 service tests catch it and try
   `System.err.println("...loadLibrary failed: ...")` to log the
   failure, which reaches `Charset.newEncoder()` → NPE because
   `jdk.internal.util.StaticProperty.<clinit>` had separately failed
   earlier with `null property: user.dir` (dalvikvm doesn't seed
   `user.dir` from cwd; no `-Duser.dir=...` arg is passed).

**The visible NPE at `PackageServiceTest.main (dex_pc=30)` is the
loadLibrary-failure-print path, not main-line code** — dex_pc=30 in
main corresponds to the `System.err.println("PackageServiceTest:
loadLibrary failed: " + sLibLoadError)` at source line 52.

**Bisection (1 file flip)**: `adb shell 'cp /data/local/tmp/westlake/bin-bionic/dalvikvm
/data/local/tmp/westlake/dalvikvm'` → full regression 14/14 PASS. No
Java code changed, no primer added, no `-Duser.dir=...` introduced.

**Fix landed**: replaced `ohos-deploy/arm64-a15/dalvikvm` with the
current `art-latest/build-bionic-arm64/bin/dalvikvm` (28266016 bytes,
SHA-256 `cd3348d7d371e52356ec08a6e9b586eab214dd24e68d1692fa10df58a7a31a8c`).

**V2 was NOT regressed**: V2-Step2/3/4/5/6 are all shadow-class Java
changes; the runtime-side `System.loadLibrary` path is in
`art-latest/stubs/openjdk_stub.c` and the binary that implements it
sits in `ohos-deploy/arm64-a15/dalvikvm` — the V2-Step7
"regression-neutral" finding (pre-Step7 dex showed identical 1 PASS /
13 FAIL) confirmed this; V2-Step7 itself was correct, the phone was
simply running the wrong dalvikvm.

**Regression**: `bash scripts/binder-pivot-regression.sh --full --no-color`
→ **14 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 SKIP** (80s). First 14/14 since V2-Step2
landed. PF-arch-054 SIGBUS in noice-discover (the CR17/CR18 surviving
FAIL) also did not recur — the CR26 substrate fix appears to hold.

### 52.9. V2 substrate cumulative footprint

**New classes (8):**
- `shim/java/android/app/Application.java` (V1 100 LOC → V2 ~430 LOC, REWRITTEN)
- `shim/java/android/app/Activity.java` (V1 1083 LOC → V2 1209 LOC, REWRITTEN)
- `shim/java/android/view/Window.java` (V1 876 LOC → V2 423 LOC, REWRITTEN)
- `shim/java/com/android/internal/policy/PhoneWindow.java` (NEW, 44 LOC)
- `shim/java/com/android/internal/policy/DecorView.java` (NEW, 22 LOC)
- `shim/java/com/android/internal/policy/WindowControllerCallback.java` (NEW, 13 LOC)
- `shim/java/android/view/WindowManagerImpl.java` (NEW, 87 LOC)
- `shim/java/com/westlake/services/ResourceArscParser.java` (NEW, 419 LOC)
- `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeAssetManager.java` (NEW, 190 LOC)
- `shim/java/com/westlake/services/WestlakeResources.java` (V1 545 LOC → V2 332 LOC, REWRITTEN)

**Wiring change:**
- `shim/java/android/app/WestlakeActivityThread.java` attachActivity
  -432 LOC (V1 274-LOC reflection + try/catch → V2 10-LOC direct call).

**`framework_duplicates.txt` comment-outs (3):**
- L83 `android/app/Activity` (V2-Step2)
- L95-97 `android/app/Application` (V2-Step3)
- L1567 `android/view/Window` (V2-Step5)

**V1 plant code deleted (~440 LOC):**
- M4-PRE12 `createSyntheticAssetManager` (~85 LOC, V2-Step4)
- M4-PRE13 `plantLocaleState` (~36 LOC, V2-Step4)
- M4-PRE14 `plantDisplayAdjustments` (~48 LOC, V2-Step4)
- `WestlakeResources.buildReflective` + `unsafeAllocateInstance` (~75 LOC, V2-Step4)
- CR23-fix try/catch wrap on attach + `buildBaseContext` fallback (~30 LOC, V2-Step6)
- WestlakeActivityThread reflection helpers (~183 LOC, V2-Step6)
- WestlakeLauncher `wireStandaloneActivityResources` + 5 helpers (294 LOC, V2-Step7)

**Regression**: 14/14 PASS (post-V2-Step8-fix).

### 52.10. What V2 does NOT yet deliver

- **End-to-end user-pixel-visible noice/McD on phone**: V2 makes the
  substrate regression-clean, but the M6 surface daemon (V2-Step9, allocated
  separately) is needed for actual rendering. noice-discover reaches PHASE
  G4 (`MainActivity.onCreate` body executing); McD reaches PHASE G3.
- **Multi-Activity Intent handling** (`BINDER_PIVOT_DESIGN_V2.md` §8.4 HIGH
  open question).
- **AndroidX `super.mFoo` field access compatibility** (§8.1 MEDIUM).
- **AppCompatDelegate full compatibility** (§8.3 MEDIUM).
- **CR15's widened guard / CR24's workaround / `ColdBootstrap.ensure()`**
  retained as belt-and-suspenders; can be deleted in future cleanup
  (V2-Step7 documented).

### 52.11. Person-time accounting

| Step | Person-time | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| V2-Step1 (API surface) | ~2.5h | 5h |
| V2-Step2 (WACT) | ~3h 10m | 15h |
| V2-Step3 (WAPP) | ~1h 5m | 5h |
| V2-Step4 (WRES2 + arsc) | ~2.5h | 15h |
| V2-Step5 (WWIN) | ~75m | 5h |
| V2-Step6 (attachActivity rewire) | ~50m | 5h |
| V2-Step7 (plant residue audit) | ~2h | 5h |
| V2-Step8-fix (regression FAIL→PASS) | ~1h 30m | 2-3h |
| **Total** | **~14h** | (originally 13 person-days; came in well under) |
